<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Stylish Life: Golf</h2><p>Golf is a sport with an illustrious pedigree. From the &#34;home of golf,&#34; the Royal and Ancient St. Andrews, it has migrated from its Scottish homeland to the globe&#39;s most fashionable corners. Defined by a distinctive and quirky dress code, golf is as much about good-natured wagering that accompanies each round. For this very reason, it attracts socialites, captains of industry, and prominent celebrities looking to relax in sylvan surroundings. Access to clubs is highly coveted for the prestige it grants--as well as the sporting pleasures. But readers can bypass the pesky membership committees as they embark on an illustrated tour of the world&#39;s finest courses and clubhouses--not to mention glimpses of the stylish players who consider the fairways &#34;a home away from home.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>What Does Baby Want?</h2><p><p><strong>This baby is not comforted by a teddy bear or toy.

All-around brilliant."&#x2014;<em>Kirkus STARRED Review</em></p><p>"Daughter loved it, giggling and very happy. Then read it again. And again!" &#x2014;<em>Hollie McNish, acclaimed British poet, author</em></p><p>"Tupera's board book is the kind of surprising, canny offering that makes you wonder how no one else did it first... Very well done, and something you don't see every day. Unless you do."&#x2014;<em>Booklist</em></p><p>"What Does Baby Want is a large, round board book for the breastfeeding mother that hits the nail on the head - er, the nipple on the boob - for what babies actually want... celebrate[s] nursing with a straightforward, simple, and beautifully illustrated tribute to breastfeeding... Normalizing the breast in baby books is a huge leap forward for that segment of the publishing world." &#x2014;<em>Baby Center</em></p><p>"My favorite book of the year: <em>What Does Baby Want?</em>... Because for many older siblings, this... is a daily reality.

Perfect for reading aloud to nursing babies and their older siblings."&#x2014;<em>Baby London</em></p><p>"At a time when breastfeeding in public can still court reproach, this is a joyful, cheeky, and candid expression of one of the most elemental ways that mothers nurture their children."&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly STARRED Review</em></p><p>"An utterly fantastic little board book with an innovative 'round' design that plopped into our review pile, making us both giggle and 'awww' at the same time. A really lovely 'first book' for a new baby, as mums and dads settle into a routine and (hopefully) make reading aloud to their little ones a part of that too." &#x2014;<em>Read It Daddy</em></p><p>"Entertaining ... a light hearted and extremely funny story about breast feeding. Highly appealing and playful... A great little gift for baby showers!" &#x2014;<em>South Wales Evening Post</em></p><p>"Cut in an unusual circular shape, it tells the story of an unhappy baby and a mama trying to find out what he wants. Brilliantly illustrated, the book features a spread of a pair of boobs, which my children found hilarious, but it's so nice to see breastfeeding normalised in a baby book! It also has close-ups of the baby's face that babies will be instantly drawn to. A sweet gift for a new nursing mama and her little one." &#x2014;<em>BambinoGoodies.co.uk</em></p></p><h2>Daemonologie: A Critical Edition. Expanded. In Modern English with Notes</h2><p>At a time when news of strange sicknesses, sudden deaths and a widespread interest in witchcraft was discovered in the kingdom, a response to the pandemic was published in a dissertation written by King James. This dissertation provided the public with special knowledge regarding the history, practices and study of magick but also included the differences between ancient Witchcraft, Necromancy, Sorcery and the magick arts with all the sub categories and derivatives. This dissertation not only explains in detail the history and practices of ancient witchcraft but takes care to educate the reader of the various forms and workings of the infernal order of demons; detailing the demonology of Satan, Spectra; evil spirits, Ziim, Iim, Incubi, Succubi, faries, brownies, familiar spirits and even further elaborates on the daemonic and demoniac sufferings of haunting, obsession and possession. This work became the inspiration of Shakespeare's Macbeth and even became a "how to" witch-hunter's manual that was studied and used by the infamous Matthew Hopkins who within just 2 years launched a series of witch hunts that resulted in the executions of an estimated 300 witches. The first publication of his work included a case study of how King James himself partook in a witch trial during the year 1591 that uncovered a plot to sabotage his wife, the Queen of Scots and overthrow the throne of Scotland with the use of satanic rituals and animal sacrifice. This dissertation titled D�monologie was published in 1597, prior to the first publication of the King James Version of the Bible in 1611 and shows how the Original Hebrew of the Biblical Old Testament had contained within its verses the names of demonic or angelic entities that instead appear as animals in all the Greek and Latin translations from which the KJV derived. This edition of D�monologie has been fully transcribed, edited and translated into modern English. It is further annotated with explanatory notes, definitions and also expanded with more content and contains discovery from more witch trial records that took place during the reign of King James, not previously published in the original.<br>The content is as follows:<br>Book I. - The Description of Magic.<br>Division of the Arts<br>Etymology. The Difference Between Necromancy &amp; Witchcraft.<br>Rudiments &amp; Devil&#x2019;s School. Division of Astrology<br>The Use of Charms. Forms of Circles &amp; Conjurations<br>The Devil&#x2019;s Contract in Two Parts. Miracles of God vs Devil.<br><br>Book II. - The Description of Sorcery &amp; Witchcraft.<br>Biblical Proof vs Imagination &amp; Myth.<br>Etymology of Sorcery. The First path of Apprenticeship<br>Division of a Witch&#x2019;s Actions. Adoration of their Master<br>Method of Transportation &amp; The Illusions of Satan<br>The Curse &amp; Remedy of Diseases<br>Least and Most Subject to Harm. <br>The Appearance of a Devil (Demonic Forms)<br>The Times and Forms a Devil Appears. / Denial<br><br>Book III. - The Description of the Spirits.<br>The Four Principle Kinds. <br>Spectra. Method of Avoiding Their Trouble.<br>Obsession &amp; Possession.<br>On Daemoniacs and the Possessed<br>Incubi &amp; Succubi<br>Faries<br>Of the Trials and Punishments of Witches.<br>Witch Trials:<br><br>The North Berwick Witch Trials &amp; the Death of Dr. Fian. Where an infamous group of witches (approximately 200) testified to plotting against the throne of Scotland and a satanic sacrificial ritual was performed to as an attempt kill the Queen of Scots, wife of prince James.<br><br>The Discovery of the Witchcraft of Joane Flower and her daughters Margret and Phillip Flower that describes peculiar events revolving around the sudden and mysterious death of the honorable Frances, Earl of Rutland and all the examinations and confessions of the witches in Leicestershire that were used as evidence in the trial that took place during King James' reign of England.</p><p>King James became the VI King of Scotland on the 24th July 1567 and the I King of England and Ireland on 24th March 1603 and remained so until his death. He authorized the 1611 English publication of the King James Version of the bible that is widely used to this day and still regarded as the official biblical standard among protestants all over the world. This resulted in a famous gunpowder plot to blow up parliament by Guy Fawkes as a desperate attempt of the Roman Catholic Church to put an end to an English Version of that bible that would threaten their influential power and control over Europe. King James influenced not only religion but art as well. Shakespeare himself referenced King James' D�monologie in the work of Macbeth that has in and of itself impacted modern society's approach to the artistic representation of witchcraft, occultism and religion. James' legacy continues to influence the world and remains as one of the greatest monarchs that helped shape the modern religious movements in Protestantism. <p></p> Other works by King James:: <p></p> The Essayes of a Prentise in the Divine Art of Poesie, (also called Some Reulis and Cautelis), 1584; <p></p> His Majesties Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres, 1591; (Lepanto, poem); <p></p> Daemonologie, 1597; <p></p> The True Law of Free Monarchies, 1598; <p></p> Basilikon Doron, 1599; <p></p> A Counterblaste to Tobacco, 1604; <p></p> An Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance, 1608; <p></p> A Premonition to All Most Mightie Monarches, 1609; <p></p></p><h2>Catholic Children&#39;s Illustrated Bible-NAB</h2><p><p>There are more than 5 million copies of this publication in circulation.

With expertise in various subdisciplines of Old Testament backgrounds, the authors illuminate the cultural, social, and historical contexts of the world behind the Old Testament. They introduce readers to a wide range of background materials, covering history, geography, archaeology, and ancient Near Eastern textual and iconographic studies.<br><br>Meant to be used alongside traditional literature-based canonical surveys, this one-stop introduction to Old Testament backgrounds fills a gap in typical introduction to the Bible courses. It contains over 100 illustrations, including photographs, line drawings, maps, charts, and tables, which will facilitate its use in the classroom.</p><p><b>"Authoritative but eminently readable"<br><br></b>"No sound interpretation of the Old Testament can afford to ignore the world from which the text came. Physical, historical, archaeological, cultural, social, and religious features all need to be taken into account. Available information, however, is usually scattered through many publications and difficult for students to access. In this volume the editors have done sterling work in gathering a galaxy of leading specialists to collect and present all such relevant information in modest-length chapters that present the data in an authoritative but eminently readable manner. Coursework and personal study stand to be hugely enriched by this valuable compendium."<br>--<b>H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;M. Williamson</b>, University of Oxford<br><br>"Featuring an outstanding range of international contributors, <i>Behind the Scenes of the Old Testament</i> is an up-to-date introduction to the theological, social, and historical contexts of the Hebrew Scriptures. The attention paid to neglected topics, such as climate, economy, foodways, historical geography, iconography, music/dance, social stratification, trade, and women--in addition to the substantial attention given to archaeology, history, kingship, literature, prophecy/divination, and worship--is most welcome."<br>--<b>Gary Knoppers</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"As the editors of <i>Behind the Scenes of the Old Testament</i> remind us, the Old Testament, while written for us, was not written to us. We must understand the world in which the Old Testament was written to interpret it for our world today.

It provoked controversy when written, provoked further debate when translated into Latin by Rufinus in the fourth century, and was the subject, together with its author, of condemnation in the sixth century. As a result, the work no longer survives intact in the original Greek.

It was constructed in about the same way, that is, by doing one piece at a time of the larger theoretical structure. It is a predecessor to work yet to be done toward the construction of a comprehensive, systematic and empirically based general psychology and philosophy which includes both the depths and the heights of human nature. The last chapter is to some extent a program for this future work, and serves as a bridge to it. It is a first attempt to integrate the &#34;health-and-growth psychology&#34; with psychopathology and psychoanalytic dynamics, the dynamic with the holistic, Becoming with Being, good with evil, positive with negative. Phrased in another way, it is an effort to build on the general psychoanalytic base and on the scientific-positivistic base of experimental psychology, the Eupsychian, B-psychological and metamotivational superstructure which these two systems lack, going beyond their limits. It is very difficult, I have found, to communicate to others my simultaneous respect for and impatience with these two comprehensive psychologies. So many people insist on being either pro-Freudian or anti-Freudian, pro-scientific-psychology or anti-scientific-psychology, etc. In my opinion all such loyalty-positions are silly. Our job is to integrate these various truths into the whole truth, which should be our only loyalty.</p><p></p><h2>Gujarat Files: Anatomy of a cover up</h2><p>Gujarat Files is the account of an eight-month long undercover investigation by journalist Rana Ayyub into the Gujarat riots, fake encounters and the murder of state Home Minister Haren Pandya that brings to the fore startling revelations. Posing as Maithili Tyagi, a filmmaker from the American Film Institute Conservatory, Rana met bureaucrats and top cops in Gujarat who held pivotal positions in the state between 2001 and 2010. The transcripts of the sting operation reveal the complicity of the state and its officials in crimes against humanity. With sensational disclosures about cases that run parallel to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah&#x2019;s ascent to power and their journey from Gujarat to New Delhi, the book tells you the hushed truth of the state in the words of those who developed amnesia while speaking before commissions of enquiry, but held nothing back in the secretly taped videos which form the basis of this remarkable read.</p><p></p><h2>Rustic Joyful Food: Generations: (Mother&#39;s Day Gifts for Home Cooks, Family-Oriented Cookbook with Simple and Delicious Recipes from the Heart)</h2><p><p>"Like me, Danielle Kartes realizes that food is the great connector&#x2015;a conduit to bring people together around the table and create new memories." &#x2015;Rachael Ray, for <em>Rustic Joyful Food: My Heart's Table</em></p><p><strong>What makes food special?

It is the whole man and the whole mission to which he is called that must be considered: both its natural, earthly aspects and its supernatural, eternal aspects. Pope Paul VI, <strong>Humanae Vitae</strong></p> <p>Pope Paul VI's prophetic encyclical <strong>Humanae Vitae</strong>, issued in 1968, presented the Church's consistent teachings on marriage and contraception to the modern world a world that demanded then, as it does now, that the Church adapt her teachings to itself. Standing calmly and firmly against a culture that sees contraception and abortion as individual choices, <strong>Humanae Vitae</strong> shows us what it means to share in the creative work of God. Paul VI lays out God's plan for human sexuality, a plan that invites married couples to celebrate the incredible gifts of human love and human life.</p> <p><strong>Humanae Vitae</strong> is a loving and honest look at the benefits and the challenges of Church teaching, and a call to the Church to provide guidance and support for couples as they strive to live out God's design for human life and marriage. </p></p><p></p><h2>Hal Leonard Guitar Method - Book 3 (Book/Online Audio)</h2><p>(Guitar Method).

With an introduction by Stephen King. <br></b><br>Death is reporter Jack McEvoy's beat: his calling, his obsession. But this time, death brings McEvoy the story he never wanted to write--and the mystery he desperately needs to solve. A serial killer of unprecedented savagery and cunning is at large. His targets: homicide cops, each haunted by a murder case he couldn't crack. The killer's calling card: a quotation from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. His latest victim is McEvoy's own brother. And his last...may be McEvoy himself.<br><strong><br></strong> <br><br></p><p>Jack McEvoy is a Denver crime reporter with the stickiest assignment of his career. His twin brother, homicide detective Sean McEvoy, was found dead in his car from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head--an Edgar Allen Poe quote smeared on the windshield. Jack is going to write the story. The problem is that Jack doesn't believe that his brother killed himself, and the more information he uncovers, the more it looks like Sean's death was the work of a serial killer. Jack's research turns up similar cases in cities across the country, and within days, he's sucked into an intense FBI investigation of an Internet pedophile who may also be a cop killer nicknamed the Poet. It's only a matter of time before the Poet kills again, and as Jack and the FBI team struggle to stay ahead of him, the killer moves in, dangerously close.<p> In a break from his Harry Bosch novels--including <i>The Concrete Blonde</i> and <i>The Last Coyote</i>--Edgar-winning novelist Michael Connelly creates a new hero who is a lot greener but no less believable. <i>The Poet</i> will keep readers holding their breath until the very end: the characters are multilayered, the plot compelling, and the denouement a true surprise. Connelly fans will not be disappointed. <i>--Mara Friedman</i></p>Jack McEvoy specializes in death. As a crime reporter for the Rocky Mountain News, he has seen every kind of murder. But his professional bravado doesn&#39;t lessen the brutal shock of learning that his only brother is dead, a suicide. Jack&#39;s brother was a homicide detective, and he had been depressed about a recent murder case, a hideously grisly one, that he&#39;d been unable to solve. McEvoy decides that the best way to exorcise his grief is by writing a feature on police suicides. But when he begins his research, he quickly arrives at a stunning revelation. Following his leads, protecting his sources, muscling his way inside a federal investigation, Jack grabs hold of what is clearly the story of a lifetime. He also knows that in taking on the story, he&#39;s making himself the most visible target for a murderer who has eluded the greatest investigators alive.</p><h2>Unveiled Mysteries</h2><p>2011 Reprint of 1935 edition.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition.<br><br><i>Exalting Jesus in 1, 2 &amp; 3 John</i> is written by Daniel L.

He earned a Ph.D. in preaching from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary and serves as associate professor of Preaching at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. His books include <i>Faithful Preaching</i> and <i>Orphanology</i>.This book is not a traditional commentary. It does not attempt a full-scale exegesis, nor does it provide explanations of some of the subtle arguments in the Johannine Letters that bind the text together. Rather, it is an exposition of John's Letters -- demonstrated, for example, in the way most of the outlines are cast in the second person, often in the imperative, like points in many sermons. The author takes pains to connect the dominant themes of each section of the biblical text with central Christian truths. Each chapter ends with an extensive "Reflect and Discuss" section -- one of the strongest features of the book. This work will prove useful for small group study, and may encourage preachers to ponder anew how to move from what the text says to the pointed sermon.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>D. A.

The Christ-Centered Exposition series aims to do just that.&nbsp; In a postmodern age, these commentaries provide pastors and lay people an invaluable resource that is unswervingly committed to the authority of Scripture and the centrality of the Gospel in the Bible&#x2019;s storyline.<br><br><b>Dr. R. Albert Mohler Jr., President<br> The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary </b><br> It's one thing to know Bible stories; it's another to know the story of the Bible. It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series. It models for preachers and teachers how to proclaim&#x2014;with pastoral focus and exegetical care&#x2014;the beauty of the gospel from every page of Scripture.<br><br><b>Matt Smethurst</b><br> Associate Editor for The Gospel Coalition<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Round Ireland with a Fridge</h2><p><p>Have you ever made a drunken bet? Worse, still, have you eveer tried to win one? In attempting to hitchhike round Ireland wich a fridge, Tony Hawks did both, and his foolhardiness led him to one of the best experiences of his life. Joined by his trusty traveling companion-cum-domestic appliance, he made his way from Dublin to Donegal, from Sligo through Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Wicklow--and back again to Dublin. In their month of madness, Tony and his fridge met a real prince, a bogus king, and the fridge got christened. They surfed together, entered a bachelor festival, and one of them had sex without the other knowing. And unexpectedly, the fridge itself became a momentary focus for the people of Ireland.</p><p>An international bestseller, <i>Round Ireland with a Fridge</i> is a classic travel adventure in the tradition of Bill Bryson with a dash of Dave Barry.</p></p><p>On his only prior visit to Ireland, English songwriter-comic Tony Hawks had seen a man hitchhiking with a refrigerator. For years, he was wont to tell the tale during late-night drinking matches, and after one particularly heavy-duty night of partying, he awoke to find a bet scrawled pillowside: a friend wagered 100 pounds that Hawks wouldn't travel Ireland for a month with a refrigerator at his side.<p> Out of this stupid premise, a ridiculously amusing book was born. Quickly discovered by the Irish media, the thumbing Englishman finds that he and his box fridge are elevated to celebrity status, and there's no dearth of rides, places to stay, or goofy people to meet, from kings to spoons players to locals who take his fridge surfing. As insightful about the strange inner workings of Hawk's mind as it is about charming peculiarities of Irishmen--it's doubtful that Hawks would have been similarly embraced by Germans, Italians, or the French--<i>Round Ireland with a Fridge</i> is an entirely silly, heartwarming tale told in a rollicking funny and refreshing style. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Part autobiography, part travelogue, part Guinness-addled ramblings." -<i>The Irish Times</i></p><h2>Fur &amp; Purr: The Funniest Things People Have Said about CATS (Quippery - The Funniest Things People Have Said)</h2><p><p><b><strong>Hours of all-star laughter for cat lovers.&nbsp;</strong><br></b></p><p>Beautifully illustrated, with laugh-out-loud humor from Ellen DeGeneres � Dave Barry � The New Yorker � The Onion � Steve Martin � Drew Barrymore � Paula Poundstone � Steven Wright � George Carlin � Sarah Silverman � Rita Rudner � Rodney Dangerfield &#x2014; and many more.

Great read!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robby Krieger, The Doors</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like a master bandleader, Alan Paul orchestrates a bluesy, jazzy, rocking chorale of voices telling the tale of a brotherhood under stress and a band who got what they hardly realized they wanted, lost what they had and fought a decades-long struggle to get it back.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Charles Shaar Murray, author of Crosstown Traffic: Jimi Hendrix and Post-War Pop and Boogie Man: The Adventures of John Lee Hooker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul's <i>One Way Out</i> is a fresh, intelligently arranged, and satisfyingly complete telling of the lengthy (and unlikely) history of the group that almost singlehandedly brought rock up to a level of jazz-like sophistication and virtuosity, introducing it as a medium worthy of the soloist's art. Oral histories can be tricky things: either penetrating, delivering information and backstories that get to the heart of how timeless music was made. Or too often, they lie flat on the page, a random retelling of repeated facts and reheated yarns. I'm happy to say that Paul's is in that first category.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ashley Kahn, author of A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane's Signature Album</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul's book presents the most complete and detailed telling of the band's still-unfolding saga to date. Elizabeth Reed, Melissa and Jessica would also probably agree.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Houston Press</i></p><p>&#x201c;Though enough tomes have been published about the Allmans' troubled history to deforest half of Brazil, only Paul's book gets all the principal figures assessing and confessing. However open and moving Gregg Allman's autobio from 2012 may have been, Paul's book gives a much fuller picture of the dynamics that drive every member -- including why guitarist Dickey Betts remains so vexing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Daily News</i></p></p><h2>The Big History Timeline Wallbook: Unfold the History of the Universe&#x2015;from the Big Bang to the Present Day!</h2><p><b>Explore the world from the beginning of time until the present, in this amazing, over-sized timeline book that brings history to life!</b><p> Created in association with the American Museum of Natural History, the timeline is uniquely broken out into 12 sections, including by subject areas (such as sea, land) and continents, as well as by date, with over 1,000 pictures and captions. From the rise of the dinosaur to the creation of the smart phone, the nearly six-foot-long timeline allows you to compare events across the world at any given moment in time.

This unique wallbook includes a 2 metre-long fold-out timeline with over 1,000 pictures and captions that tell the story of the history of the world. The timeline is divided into 12 sections covering both natural history (this really helps put events into context and give a wider meaning than more timelines offer) as well as the history of human civilisations in each of the world's continents. It's amazingly clear to read, despite the small print needed to get all the information in. In case you struggle, though, there's a magnifier slotted into a pocket at the front of the book. Good use of background colours helps separate out each continent and it's simple to compare what was happening across the world at any given moment in time. As well as the timeline, the Wallbook Chronicle includes more than 30 newspaper-style articles and a 50-question quiz. Perfect for 6-14 year olds but equally fascinating for all curious adults.It's a book that will intrigue all ages, with so much to learn and appreciate.

After graduating from Oxford, he worked for a while as an editor of comics and children&#39;s books before turning to writing full time. In the dozen or so years since then, he has written for such a diverse range of characters--including Scooby-Doo, Thunderbirds, Conan the Barbarian, The X-Men, Johnny Bravo, Batman, Rupert the Bear, Doctor Who, Mr. Men, The Terminator and Postman Pat--that he is now clinically bewildered.

Gather the other descendants, defeat a giant serpent, and save the world. No problem, right?<br><br>Wrong. The descendants' journey grinds to a halt when their friend Baldwin is poisoned and Matt, Fen, and Laurie must travel to the Underworld in hopes of saving him. From there, they'll have to reunite the challengers, find Thor's hammer, and save humanity - that is, if they can survive a journey filled with enough monstrous beasts and godly enemies to make Matt and his friends legends in their own right.</p><p>K.L. Armstrong and M.A. Marr had been friends for several years and found themselves spending hours talking about mythology and monsters. With that shared interest, in addition to K.L.'s love for tackling creatures in video games when not writing (and sometimes when she's supposed to be writing), their monster and myth fixation, and the books they read with their 11- to 13-year-old sons, they knew they had to write the Blackwell Pages. <br>This sequel to Loki&#x2019;s Wolves (2013) delivers plenty of action as well as reflective moments for its five main characters, teens descended from the Norse gods Thor, Loki, Baldur, and Odin. Former middle-school classmates Matt, Laurie, and Fen rescue their friend Baldwin from the underworld, defeat a cave bear, and fight many zombie-like draugrs, while their ally Owen faces his own challenges, rejoining his pals when he can. All the young descendants of the gods struggle to come to terms with their roles in the coming epic battle foretold in Norse mythology. The second volume in the fast-paced Blackwell Pages series, this flows well, developing the main characters and offering moments of humor even as it delivers exciting scenes of quest, combat, and adventure. Narrative shifts from one teen hero to another add further dimension to the story as the characters confront personal insecurities, suspicions of each other, and their terrifying enemies. Keep this series in mind for Percy Jackson fans in search of fresh reading material. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: The Blackwell Pages looks poised to join Armstrong and Marr&#x2019;s previous series on the bestseller lists, and the extra push from a multi-platform marketing campaign should help.

A professor is missing&#x2014;and the one person who can find him is not only the most inept magician the school ever produced, but currently stranded on the unfinished down-under continent of Fourecks.</p><p>As the UU faculty tries to bring him back, Rincewind is having troubles of his own, thanks to a pushy mystical kangaroo trickster named Scrappy and a mob of Fourecks hooligans who are out to hang him. All his problems would be solved if he could just make it rain . . . for the first time ever. And if the time-traveling professors can get to the right millennium . . .</p></p><p>Terry Pratchett's 22nd Discworld novel, <i>The Last Continent</i>, is a lighthearted tour of the fantasy land of Fourecks, a very Australian sort of place, with brief courses in theoretical physics and evolution thrown in for good measure. Pratchett returns to his first Discworld protagonist, the inept and cowardly wizard Rincewind, who habitually runs into trouble as fast as he flees. Rincewind's arrival in Fourecks has distorted the space-time continuum, and he has to sort it out before the whole place dries up and blows away. The situation is complicated because the actual problem is located 30,000 years in the past--just where the Faculty of the Unseen University currently are. Pretty frightening, given "the true wizard's instinct to amble aimlessly into dangerous places," and then "stop and argue ... about exactly what kind of danger it [is]."<p> If you're baffled by all this, no worries, mate. You needn't have read Pratchett before--not even the five previous Discworld novels starring Rincewind (<i>The Colour of Magic</i>, <i>The Light Fantastic</i>, <i>Sourcery</i>, <i>Eric</i>, and <i>Interesting Times</i>)--to enjoy this latest romp. Nor to have visited Australia. When you finish, however, you'll likely want to rush out and do both. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series.

Maria Merian (1647&#x2013;1717) was captivated by the metamorphosis of the caterpillar. Despite common superstitions about shape-shifting magic, Merian secretly collected and observed first silkworms, then caterpillars, to document the science beneath the mystery. She grew up to create incredible paintings of insects, including butterflies and other wonders of the natural world. Mary Anning (1799&#x2013;1847) shared her father's curiosity about fossils entombed in the rocks of their New England home. Her findings were painstakingly excavated by chiseling away each layer of rock. Maria Mitchell (1818&#x2013;89), who tirelessly watched the heavens for both consistency and change, discovered a new comet and became one of the first women to be accepted into the American Academy of Arts and Science. Atkins skillfully conveys the importance of these women's scientific contributions to the world, while also imagining the complexities of their lives as daughters, wives, and sisters during times when female scientists were marginalized or ignored. The verse is effective&#x2014;evocative and beautiful. VERDICT Highly recommended for fans of poetry about the natural world and the lives of real people.&#x2014;Patricia Feriano, Montgomery County Public Schools, MD</p><h2>Wicca: A Modern Guide to Witchcraft and Magick</h2><p><b>Witchcraft and Wicca for a modern world, from YouTube vlogger and Instagram sensation Harmony Nice </b> <br> Welcome to Generation "Hex"--an era where young Americans know that witchcraft isn't about devil worship and spooky curses, and instead are openly embracing meaningful Wiccan rituals that can enrich our lives in real-world ways.

An Academy Award winner for his screenplay for <i>The Exorcist</i>, Blatty is not only the author of one of the most terrifying novels ever written, but, paradoxically, also cowrote the screenplay for the hilarious Inspector Clouseau film, <i>A Shot in the Dark. New York Times</i> reviewers of his early comic novels noted, "Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty," describing him as "a gifted virtuoso who writes like S. J. Perelman."<b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>He thought of death in its infinite groanings, of Aztecs ripping out living hearts and of cancer and three-year-olds buried alive and he wondered whether God was alien and cruel, but then remembered Beethoven and the dappling of things and &#x201c;Hurrah for Karamazov&#x201d; and kindness. He stared at the sun coming up behind the Capitol, streaking the Potomac with orange light, and then down at the outrage, the horror at his feet. Something had gone wrong between man and his creator, and the evidence was here on this boathouse dock.<br>&#x201c;I think they&#x2019;ve found it, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The hammer. They&#x2019;ve found it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The hammer. Oh, yes.&#x201d;<br>Kinderman&#x2019;s thoughts found a grip on the world. He looked up and saw the crime lab crew on the dock. They were gathering with eyedropper, test tube and forceps; remembering with camera, sketchpad and chalk. Their voices were hushed, mere whispered fragments, and they moved without sound, gray figures in a dream. Nearby, the blue police dredgeboat&#x2019;s engines churned with the morning&#x2019;s completion of dread.<br>&#x201c;Well, I guess we&#x2019;re almost finished here, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are we really? Is that so?&#x201d;<br>Kinderman squinted against the cold. The search helicopter was skimming away, throbbing low above the mud-brown darkness of the waters with its lights blinking softly red and green. The detective watched it growing smaller. It dwindled in the dawn like a fading hope. He listened, inclining his head a little; then he shivered and his hands began to dig deeper into the pockets of his coat. The shrieking of the woman had grown more piercing. It clawed at his heart and the twisted forests silent on the banks of the icy river.<br>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; someone huskily murmured.<br>Kinderman looked at Stedman. The police pathologist was down on one knee beside a sheet of soiled canvas. Something lumpy lay under it. Stedman was staring at it, frowning in concentration. His body was motionless. Only his breath had life; it came frosty and then vanished in the hungry air. Abruptly he stood up and looked at Kinderman oddly. &#x201c;You know those cuts on the victim&#x2019;s left hand?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I think they&#x2019;ve got a pattern.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I think so. A sign of the zodiac. I think Gemini.&#x201d;<br>Kinderman&#x2019;s heart skipped a beat. He drew a breath. Then he looked at the river. A Georgetown University crew team scull slipped silent and slim behind the bulky stern of the dredge. It reappeared, and then vanished underneath Key Bridge. A strobe light flashed. Kinderman looked down at the canvas throwsheet. <i>No. It couldn&#x2019;t be,</i> he thought. <i>It couldn&#x2019;t be.</i><br>The pathologist followed Kinderman&#x2019;s gaze and his hand, blotched red from the freezing air, pulled the folds of his coat collar tighter together. He regretted not wearing his scarf that day. He&#x2019;d forgotten. He&#x2019;d dressed in too much of a hurry. &#x201c;What a weird way to die,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;So unnatural.&#x201d;<br>Kinderman&#x2019;s breathing was emphysematous; white vapor wisped at his lips. &#x201c;No death is natural,&#x201d; he murmured.<br>Someone had created the world. <i>Made sense.</i> For why would an eye want to form? To see? And why should it see? In order to survive? And why should it survive? And why? And why? The child&#x2019;s question haunted the nebulae, a thought in search of its maker that cornered reason in a dead-end maze and made Kinderman certain the materialist universe was the greatest superstition of his age. He believed in wonders but not in the impossible: not in an infinite regression in contingencies, or that love and acts of will were reducible to neurons firing in the brain.<br>&#x201c;How long has the Gemini been dead?&#x201d; asked Stedman.<br>&#x201c;Ten, twelve years,&#x201d; answered Kinderman. &#x201c;Twelve.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are we <i>certain</i> that he&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is dead.&#x201d;<br><i>In a sense</i>, thought Kinderman. <i>Partly.</i> Man was not a nerve net. Man had a soul. For how could matter reflect upon itself? And how was it Carl Jung had seen a ghost in his bed and confession of a sin could cure a bodily illness and the atoms of his body were continually changing, yet each morning he awakened and was still himself? Without an afterlife, what was the value of work? What was the point of evolution?<br>&#x201c;He is dead on the bias,&#x201d; Kinderman murmured.<br>&#x201c;What was that, Lieutenant?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br>Electrons traveled from point to point without ever traversing the space between. God had His mysteries. Yahweh: &#x201c;I shall be there as who I am shall I be there.&#x201d; <i>Okay. Amen.</i> But it was all so confusing, such a mess. The creator made man to know right from wrong, to feel outrage at all that was monstrous and evil; yet the scheme of creation itself was outrageous, for the law of life was the law of feeding in a universe crammed from end to end with exploding stars and bloodied jaws. Avoid being food and there was always a chance you would die in a mudslide or in an earthquake or in your crib or you might be fed rat poison by your mother or fried in oil by Genghis Khan or be skinned alive or beheaded or suffocated just for the thrill of it, for the fun of it. Forty-three years on the force and he had seen it. Hadn&#x2019;t he seen it all? <i>And now this.</i> For a moment he attempted familiar escapes: imagining the universe and everything in it were merely thoughts in the mind of the creator; or that the world of external reality existed nowhere but in his own head, so that nothing outside of him actually suffered. Sometimes it worked.<br>This time it didn&#x2019;t.<br>Kinderman studied the lump beneath the canvas. No, it wasn&#x2019;t this, he thought: not the evil that we choose or inflict. The horror was the evil in the fabric of creation. The songs of the whales were haunting and lovely but the lion ripped open the stomach of the wildebeest and the tiny ichneumonids fed in the living bodies of caterpillars underneath the pretty lilacs and the lawns; the black-throated honey guide bird chattered gaily but it laid its eggs in alien nests and when the baby honey guide hatched it immediately killed its foster brethren with a hard, sharp hook near the tip of its beak, which it promptly shed upon completion of the slaughter. <i>What immortal hand or eye?</i> Kinderman grimaced at an awful recollection of a hospital psycho ward for children. In a room there were fifty beds with cages, each with a shrieking child inside. Among them was an eight-year-old whose bones had not grown since infancy. Could the glory and beauty of creation justify the pain of one such child? Ivan Karamazov deserved an answer.<br>&#x201c;Elephants are dying of coronaries, Stedman.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Beg pardon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the jungle. They are dying of stress about their food and their water supply. They try to help one another. If one of them dies too far away then the others take its bones to the burial ground.&#x201d;<br>The pathologist blinked and clutched at the folds of his coat more tightly. He&#x2019;d heard of these flights, these irrelevant sallies, and that they&#x2019;d been occurring with frequency lately; but this was the first he had personally witnessed. Rumors had been drifting and circling through the precinct that Kinderman, colorful or not, was getting senile, and Stedman examined him now with an air of professional interest, seeing nothing unusual in the detective&#x2019;s manner of dress: the oversized, tattered gray tweed coat; the rumpled trousers, baggy and cuffed; the limp felt hat, in the band a feather plucked from some mottled, disreputable bird. <i>The man is a walking thrift shop</i>, he thought, and his eye caught an egg stain here and there. But this much had always been Kinderman&#x2019;s style, he knew. Nothing unusual there. Nor in his physical being: the short, fat fingers were neatly manicured, the jowly cheeks gleamed of soap, and the moist brown eyes which drooped at the corners still seemed to be staring into times gone by. As ever, his manner and his delicate movements suggested an old-world Viennese father perpetually engaged in the arranging of flowers.<br>&#x201c;And at Princeton University,&#x201d; Kinderman continued, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re doing experiments with chimpanzees. The chimp pulls a lever and out from this machine comes a nice banana. So far, so wonderful, correct? But now the good doctors build a little cage and they put a different chimp inside it. Then along comes the first chimp looking for his usual sturgeon and bagel, only this time when the lever gets pulled, the banana comes out, all right, but the chimp sees his pal in the cage is now screaming from electrical shock. After that, no matter how hungry or starving he is, the first chimp won&#x2019;t pull the lever whenever he sees another chimp in that cage. They tried it on fifty, a hundred chimps, and every time it was the same. All right, maybe some <i>goniff</i>, some smartass Dillinger type, some sadist would pull the lever; but ninety percent of the time they wouldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br>Kinderman continued to stare at the canvas. Two Neanderthal skeletons discovered in France were examined and found to have lived for two years despite seriously incapacitating injuries. Clearly, he thought, the tribe had kept them alive. <i>And look at children</i>, he pondered. There was nothing keener, the detective knew, than a child&#x2019;s sense of justice, of what was fair, of how things should be. Where did that come from? <i>And when my Julie was three, you couldn&#x2019;t give her a cookie or a toy but she&#x2019;d give it away to some other kid.</i> Later on she&#x2019;d <i>learned</i> to hoard it for herself. It wasn&#x2019;t power that corrupted, he thought; it was the jostling and unfairness of the world of experience and a bag of M and M&#x2019;s with short weigh...</p><h2>A Death in Vienna</h2><p><b>"An engrossing portrait of a legendary period as well as a brain teaser of startling perplexity" --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b>In Vienna at the turn of the twentieth century, Max Liebermann is at the forefront of psychoanalysis, practicing the controversial new science with all the skill of a master detective.

I remember it well because my<br>father&#x2014;Mendel Liebermann&#x2014;had suggested that we meet for<br>coffee at The Imperial. I had a strong suspicion that something<br>was on his mind. . . .<br><br></i>A roiling mass of black cloud had risen from behind the Opera<br>House like a volcanic eruption of sulphurous smoke and ash. Its dimensions<br>suggested impending doom&#x2014;an epic catastrophe on the<br>scale of Pompeii. In the strange amber light, the surrounding buildings<br>had become jaundiced. Perched on the rooftops, the decorative<br>statuary&#x2014;classical figures and triumphal eagles&#x2014;seemed to have<br>been carved from brimstone. A fork of lightning flowed down the<br>mountain of cloud like a river of molten iron. The earth trembled and<br>the air stirred, yet still there was no rain. The coming storm seemed to<br>be saving itself&#x2014;building its reserves of power in preparation for an<br>apocalyptic deluge.<br>The streetcar bell sounded, rousing Liebermann from his reverie<br>and dispersing a group of horse-drawn carriages on the lines.<br>As the streetcar rolled forward, Liebermann wondered why his father<br>had wanted to see him. It wasn&#x2019;t that such a meeting was unusual;<br>they often met for coffee. Rather, it was something about the manner<br>in which the invitation had been issued. Mendel&#x2019;s voice had been curiously<br>strained&#x2014;reedy and equivocal. Moreover, his nonchalance<br>had been unconvincing, suggesting to Liebermann the concealment of<br>an ulterior&#x2014;or perhaps even unconscious&#x2014;motive. But what might<br>that be?<br>The streetcar slowed in the heavy traffic of the Karntner Ring, and<br>Liebermann jumped off before the vehicle had reached its stop. He<br>raised the collar of his astrakhan coat against the wind and hurried<br>toward his destination.<br>Even though lunch had already been served, The Imperial was<br>seething with activity. Waiters, with silver trays held high, were<br>dodging one another between crowded tables, and the air was filled<br>with animated conversation. At the back of the caf�, a pianist was<br>playing a Chopin mazurka. Liebermann wiped the condensation off<br>his spectacles with a handkerchief and hung his coat on the stand.<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Herr Doctor.&#x201d;<br>Liebermann recognized the voice and without turning replied,<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Bruno. I trust you are well?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am, sir. Very well indeed.&#x201d;<br>When Liebermann turned, the waiter continued. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to<br>come this way, sir. Your father is already here.&#x201d;<br>Bruno beckoned, and guided Liebermann through the hectic<br>room. They arrived at a table near the back, where Mendel was concealed<br>behind the densely printed sheets of the <i>Wiener Zeitung.<br></i>&#x201c;Herr Liebermann?&#x201d; said Bruno. Mendel folded his paper. He was<br>a thickset man with a substantial beard and bushy eyebrows. His expression<br>was somewhat severe&#x2014;although softened by a liberal network<br>of laughter lines. The waiter added, &#x201c;Your son.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ahh, Maxim!&#x201d; said the old man. &#x201c;There you are!&#x201d; He sounded a<br>little irritated, as though he had been kept waiting.<br>After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, Liebermann replied, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m early,<br>Father.&#x201d;<br>Mendel consulted his pocket watch.<br>&#x201c;So you are. Well, sit down, sit down. Another <i>pharis�er </i>for me<br>and . . . Max?&#x201d; He invited his son to order.<br>&#x201c;A <i>schwarzer, </i>please, Bruno.&#x201d;<br>The waiter executed a modest bow and was gone.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Mendel. &#x201c;How are you, my boy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very well, Father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking a bit thinner than usual.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Drawn.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you eating properly?&#x201d;<br>Liebermann laughed. &#x201c;Very well, as it happens. And how are you,<br>Father?&#x201d;<br>Mendel grimaced.<br>&#x201c;Ach! Good days and bad days, you know how it is. I&#x2019;m seeing that<br>specialist you recommended, Pintsch. And there is some improvement,<br>I suppose. But my back isn&#x2019;t much better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201d;<br>Mendel dismissed his son&#x2019;s remark with a wave of his hand.<br>&#x201c;Do you want something to eat?&#x201d; Mendel pushed the menu<br>across the table. &#x201c;You look like you need it. I think I&#x2019;ll have the <i>topfenstrudel.</i>&#x201d;<br>Liebermann studied the extensive cakelist: <i>apfeltorte, cremeschnitte,<br>truffeltorte, apfelstrudel. </i>It ran on over several pages.<br>&#x201c;Your mother sends her love,&#x201d; said Mendel, &#x201c;and would like to<br>know when she can expect to see you again.&#x201d; His expression hovered<br>somewhere between sympathy and reprimand.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Father,&#x201d; said Liebermann. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been very busy. Too<br>many patients . . . Tell mother I&#x2019;ll try to see her next week. Friday, perhaps?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you must come to dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Liebermann, suddenly feeling that he had already committed<br>himself more than he really wanted. &#x201c;Yes. Thank you.&#x201d; He<br>looked down at the menu again: <i>dobostorte, guglhupf, linzertorte. </i>The<br>Chopin mazurka ended on a loud minor chord, and a ripple of<br>applause passed through the caf� audience. Encouraged, the pianist<br>played a glittering arpeggio figure on the upper keys, under which he<br>introduced the melody of a popular waltz. A group of people seated<br>near the window began another round of appreciative clapping.<br>Bruno returned with the coffees and stood to attention with his<br>pencil and notepad.<br>&#x201c;The <i>topfenstrudel,</i>&#x201d; said Mendel.<br>&#x201c;The <i>rehr�cken, </i>please,&#x201d; said Liebermann.<br>Mendel stirred the cream into his <i>pharis�er</i>&#x2014;which came with a<br>tot of rum&#x2014;and immediately started to talk about the family textile<br>business. This was not unusual. Indeed, it had become something of a<br>tradition. Profits had risen, and Mendel was thinking of expanding<br>the enterprise: another factory, or even a shop, perhaps. Now that<br>the meddling bureaucrats had lifted the ban on department stores, he<br>could see a future in retail&#x2014;new opportunities. His old friend Blomberg<br>had already opened a successful department store and had suggested<br>that they might go into partnership. Throughout, Mendel&#x2019;s<br>expression was eager and clearly mindful of his son&#x2019;s reactions.<br>Liebermann understood why his father kept him so well informed.<br>Although he was proud of Liebermann&#x2019;s academic achievements, he<br>still hoped that one day young Max would step into his shoes.<br>Mendel&#x2019;s voice slowed when he noticed his son&#x2019;s hand. The fingers<br>seemed to be following the pianist&#x2019;s melody&#x2014;treating the edge of the<br>table like a keyboard.<br>&#x201c;Are you listening?&#x201d; said Mendel.<br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course I&#x2019;m listening,&#x201d; Liebermann replied. He had become<br>accustomed to such questioning and could no longer be caught<br>out, as was once the case. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of going into business with<br>Herr Blomberg.&#x201d;<br>Liebermann assumed a characteristic position. His right hand&#x2014;<br>shaped like a gun&#x2014;pressed against his cheek, the index finger resting<br>gently against the right temple. It was a &#x201c;listening&#x201d; position favored by<br>many psychiatrists.<br>&#x201c;So&#x2014;what do you think? A good idea?&#x201d; asked Mendel.<br>&#x201c;Well, if the existing department store is profitable, that sounds<br>reasonable enough.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a considerable investment.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is.&#x201d;<br>The old man stroked his beard. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to be very keen on<br>the idea.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Father, does it matter what I think?&#x201d;<br>Mendel sighed. &#x201c;No. I suppose not.&#x201d; His disappointment was palpable.<br>Liebermann looked away. He took no joy in disappointing his<br>father and now felt guilty. The old man&#x2019;s motives were entirely<br>laudable, and Liebermann was perfectly aware that his comfortable<br>standard of living was sustained&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;by Mendel&#x2019;s exemplary<br>management of the family business. Yet he couldn&#x2019;t ever<br>imagine himself running a factory or managing a department store.<br>The idea was ludicrous.<br>As these thoughts were passing through his mind, Liebermann noticed<br>the arrival of a gentleman in his middle years. On entering the<br>caf�, the man removed his hat and surveyed the scene. His hair was<br>combed to the side, creating a deep side parting, and his neatly<br>trimmed mustache and beard were almost entirely gray. He received a<br>warm welcome from the head waiter, who helped him to take his coat<br>off. He was immaculately dressed in pin-striped trousers, a widelapeled<br>jacket, and a &#x201c;showy&#x201d; vest. He must have made a quip, because<br>the head waiter suddenly began laughing. The man seemed in no<br>hurry to find a seat and stood by the door, listening intently to the<br>waiter, who now appeared&#x2014;Liebermann thought&#x2014;to have started<br>to tell a story.<br>Mendel saw that his son had become distracted.<br>&#x201c;Know him, do you?&#x201d;<br>Liebermann turned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dr. Freud,&#x201d; said Mendel in a flat voice.<br>Liebermann was astonished that his father knew the man&#x2019;s identity.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I do know him. And it&#x2019;s <i>Professor </i>Freud, actually.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Professor Freud, then,&#x201d; said Mendel. &#x201c;But he hasn&#x2019;t been a professor<br>for very long, has he?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A few months,&#x201d; said Liebermann, raising his eyebrows. &#x201c;How did<br>you know that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He comes to the lodge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What lodge?&#x201d;<br>Mendel scowled. &#x201c;B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh yes, of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Although God knows why. I&#x2019;m not sure what sort of a Jew he&#x2019;s<br>supposed to be. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to believe in anything. And as for his<br>ideas . . .&#x201d; Mendel shook his head. &#x201c;He gave us a talk last year.<br>Scandalous. How well do you know him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Quite well. . . . We meet occasionally to discuss his work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What? You think there&#x2019;s something in it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The book he wrote with Breuer on hysteria was excellent, and<br><i>The Interpretation of Dreams </i>is . . . well, a masterpiece. Of course, I don&#x2019;t<br>agree with everything he says. Even so, I&#x2019;ve found his treatment suggestions<br>very useful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you must be in a minority.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Undoubtedly. But I am convinced that Professor Freud&#x2019;s system&#x2014;<br>a system that he calls psychoanalysis&#x2014;will become more widely accepted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not in Vienna.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. One or two of my colleagues, other junior psychiatrists,<br>are very interested in Professor Freud&#x2019;s ideas.&#x201d;<br>Mendel&#x2019;s brow furrowed. &#x201c;Some of the things he said last year<br>were obscene. I pity those in his care.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I would be the first to admit,&#x201d; said Liebermann, &#x201c;that he has become<br>somewhat preoccupied&#x2014;of late&#x2014;with the erotic life of his patients.<br>However, his understanding of the human mind extends well<br>beyond our animal instincts.&#x201d;<br>The professor was still standing by the door with the head waiter.<br>He suddenly burst out laughing and slapped his companion on the<br>back. It was clear that the head waiter had just told him a joke.<br>&#x201c;Dear God,&#x201d; said Mendel under his breath, &#x201c;I hope he doesn&#x2019;t<br>come this way.&#x201d; Then he sighed with relief as Professor Freud was ushered<br>to a table beyond their view. Mendel was about to say something<br>else but stopped when Bruno arrived with the cakes.<br>&#x201c;<i>Topfenstrudel </i>for Herr Liebermann and <i>rehr�cken </i>for Herr Doctor<br>Liebermann. More coffee?&#x201d; Bruno gestured toward Mendel&#x2019;s empty<br>glass.<br>&#x201c;Yes, why not? A <i>m�lange, </i>and another <i>schwarzer </i>for my son.&#x201d;<br>Mendel looked enviously at his son&#x2019;s g�teau, a large glazed chocolate<br>sponge cake shaped like a saddle of deer, filled with apricot jam<br>and studded with almonds. His own order was less arresting, being a<br>simple pastry filled with sweet curd cheese.<br>Liebermann noticed his father&#x2019;s lingering gaze.<br>&#x201c;You should have ordered one too.&#x201d;<br>Mendel shook his head. &#x201c;Pintsch told me I must lose weight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you won&#x2019;t lose weight eating <i>topfenstrudel.</i>&#x201d;<br>Mendel shrugged and took a mouthful of pastry but stopped chew-<br>ing when a loud thunderclap shook the building. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a bad<br>one,&#x201d; said Mendel, nodding toward the window. Outside, Vienna had<br>succumbed to a preternatural twilight.<br>&#x201c;Maxim,&#x201d; Mendel continued, &#x201c;I wanted to see you today for a reason.<br>A specific reason.&#x201d;<br><i>At last, </i>thought Liebermann. Finally, he was about to discover the<br>true purpose of their meeting. Liebermann braced himself mentally,<br>still unsure of what to expect.<br>&#x201c;You probably think it&#x2019;s nothing to do with me,&#x201d; Mendel added.<br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped abruptly and pushed the severed corner of his<br><i>topfenstrudel </i>around the plate with his fork.<br>&#x201c;What is it, Father?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was speaking to Herr Weiss the other day and . . .&#x201d; Again his<br>sentence tailed off. &#x201c;Maxim.&#x201d; This time he returned to his task with<br>greater determination. &#x201c;You and Clara seem to be getting along well<br>enough and&#x2014;understandably, I think&#x2014;Herr Weiss is anxious to<br>know of your intentions.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My intentions?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mendel, looking at his son. &#x201c;Your intentions.&#x201d; He carried<br>on eating his cake.<br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said Liebermann, somewhat taken aback. Although he had<br>considered many subjects that his father might wish to discuss, his relationship<br>with Clara Weiss had not been one of them. Yet now the<br>omission seemed obvious.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; replied Liebermann. &#x201c;What can I say? I like Clara very<br>much.&#x201d;<br>Mendel wiped his mouth with a napkin and leaned forward.<br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And . . .&#x201d; Liebermann looked into his father&#x2019;s censorious eyes.<br>&#x201c;And . . .

One such law states that for every action there is a reaction, and that for every motion there is corresponding counter-motion. Whether it s visible to the human eye or not, one thing is certain movement and change will occur as a result. Having studied these principles, author Raymond Holliwell not only understood the universal physical applications, he also understood the spiritual and mental applications as well. By using this law on a spiritual and mental level, Holliwell found that a specific thought could create a desired reaction in his personal and professional life through continual and dedicated practice. As he came to realize the expanded potential of this powerful law, he eventually recognized the ultimate source of the dramatic results God. There are countless laws that impact on our daily lives and actions. But there are other laws just waiting to be discovered and put to work from within laws that anyone can use to live a limitless and prosperous life. After many printings, the lessons in WORKING WITH THE LAW are still being taught in numerous workshops around the country and continue to provide the reader with a new opportunity to take action and re-think their strategy for success by simply working with the law.</p><p>Dr. Raymond Holliwell had a highly logical mind and was an inspired teacher who employed a clear, specific approach to this subject making his work an excellent resource for group study.</p><h2>Turn This Book Into a Beehive!: And 19 Other Experiments and Activities That Explore the Amazing World of Bees</h2><p><b>The Real Buzz on Bees</b><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What a promise!

There have been 161 meta-analyses on various aspects of computers in education &#x2013; from 10,226 studies, and the average effect is d =.34 &#x2013; and this effect has not changed over the past 50 years despite phenomenal changes in the technology.&nbsp;A major reason for this lack of impact is most technological interventions do not change the dominant "tell and practice" teaching model. Moving beyond translation and transforming current practice to transcendent uses of technology is clearly where we should go. We need to build collaborative communities of students solving problems, explaining to others (regardless of ability) and using the social media aspects of technology to change classroom conversations from monologue to dialogue, increasing student impact questions, and allowing errors to be stated and dealt with &#x2013; this can be so transcendental. This is the core of Magana&#x2019;s claims, and indeed this is how we&#x2019;ll see technology really make the difference we&#x2019;re after!"</em></p> -- John Hattie, Laureate Professor<br><br><p><em>"The T3 Framework is a brilliant breakthrough in our understanding &nbsp;and use of technology for learning.

He enlists in hopes of finding that missing <i>something</i> in his life but comes to find out that it's not quite what he expected. Abe gets more than he bargained for when his journey takes him to the middle east in war-torn Iraq.<br><br>This is a story about a Marine, written and illustrated by a Marine, and is the first graphic novel about the war in Iraq from a veteran. <em>The White Donkey </em>explores the experience of being a Marine, as well as the challenges that veterans face upon their return home, and its raw power will leave you in awe.</p><p><em>The White Donkey </em>was written and illustrated by infantry Marine and Iraq veteran <b>Maximilian Uriarte</b>, creator of the hit comic strip "Terminal Lance." Uriarte enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 2006 at the age of 19 and served for four years. During his first deployment to Iraq in 2007 he served as an MRAP turret gunner and dismount of India Company's "Jump" platoon in the Zaidon region southeast of Fallujah. He deployed to Iraq again in 2009 as a billeted Combat Photographer and Combat Artist, then enrolling in California College of the Arts. In 2010 Uriarte created the popular comic strip "Terminal Lance" while still on active duty. The strip is now published in <i>The Marine Corps Times</i> and has grown immensely in popularity, with 450,000 Facebook followers and one million unique hits per month.<strong>Winner of the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation 2017 James Webb Award</strong><br><br> <strong>One of Barnes &amp; Noble's Best Comic and Graphic Novels of 2016</strong><br><br><strong>One of <em>The Los Angeles Times'</em> 10 Most Important Books of 2016</strong><br><br>"It was 2010 when Uriarte, a lance corporal in the Marine Corps, created the online comic 'Terminal Lance,' which swiftly developed a fan base.

Yet, tucked into the panels and frames, are those singular moments that, like a rock cast into a pond, send their ripples out almost infinitely-altering lives and ending others. <i>The White Donkey </i>follows the tremors, backwards and forwards, and manages to illustrate what feels like a 'true' war story and a lonely chapter in a war our country is trying desperately to forget."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Washington Post</em></i></b><br><br>"Few books pack the punch of <em>The White Donkey</em>. Uriarte has a genius for details that illuminate the truth and pull you into the story with cinematic fervor.

Authored by rising star activist Blair Imani, <i>Modern HERstory</i> tells the important stories of the leaders and movements that are changing the world right here and right now--and will inspire you to do the same.</p><p>BLAIR IMANI is a black queer American Muslim activist. She is the founder and executive director of Equality for HER, a nonprofit educational platform for feminine-identifying individuals. As a political journalist and commentator, she has appeared on Fox News and MSNBC, and has guest lectured at Yale and Harvard Universities. She has written for the Huffington Post and VICE and has been featured in <i>Nylon, Teen Vogue</i>, Salon, Broadly, VICE, <i>This American Life</i>, The 405, Public Radio International, and Bustle.<b>INTRODUCTION </b><br><br>When I was twelve years old, I realized that making a difference can be as simple as fighting for what you believe in, unapologetically living in your truth, or taking steps to improve the lives of others. I was fortunate to grow up with the constant encouragement from family and community members that I could realize the change I wanted to see in the world. Every one of us has the potential to make an indelible mark on our world; however, the stories of the ordinary heroes responsible for the most important social changes in history are often obscured. Studying history in college, I learned that it is usually written by those who have the most <b>privilege </b>and the most power. As a result, the contributions of diverse groups are often overlooked or erased, while those in power who uphold the status quo are praised as heroes.&nbsp;<br><br>Throughout history, diverse trailblazing individuals have been subjected to this erasure. For example, voting rights activist and civil rights leader <b>Fannie Lou Hamer </b>frequently goes unacknowledged in conversations about the <b>Civil Rights Movement</b>. Fannie Lou was a black woman born and raised in rural Mississippi, and she survived the violent oppressions faced by countless black women in the American South. After being fired from her job as a sharecropper simply because she registered to vote, she went on to dedicate her entire life to fighting for the rights of black people to direct their own futures. Fannie Lou was arrested and beaten for attempting&nbsp;to exercise rights, like voting, that America claims to promise to all its people. Similarly, few people are aware of the legacy of Chinese American experimental physicist <b>Chien-Shiung Wu</b>, a key contributor to the World War II&#x2013;era American research initiative known as the Manhattan Project. The Nobel Prize for her award-winning and eponymous Wu Experiment was given to her male colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang in 1957, despite the fact <i>she </i>developed it. Two <b>transgender </b>activists of color, <b>Sylvia Rivera </b>and <b>Marsha P. Johnson</b>, helped define the present state of <b>LGBTQ </b>rights organizing in the United States; however, their contributions continue to go unacknowledged within the LGBTQ community. Even a film documenting the historic event at which Sylvia and Marsha gained prominence, the 1969 Stonewall Riots, erased the presence of transgender women of color, instead centering the stories of white <b>gay cisgender </b>men.<br><br>While &#x201c;history&#x201d; focuses on men and the stories of patriarchs, &#x201c;<i>her</i>story&#x201d; deliberately prioritizes the stories of women, people of color, and LGBTQ people.&nbsp;<br><br>***</p><h2>Faithful to Christ: A Challenge to Truly Live for Christ</h2><p><i>Only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.</i> - 1 Samuel 12:24<br><br><b>If there is a true faith, there must be a declaration of it.</b> If you are a candle, and God has lit you, then <i>let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens</i> (Matthew 5:16). Soldiers of Christ must, like soldiers of our nation, wear their uniforms; and if they are ashamed of their uniforms, they ought to be drummed out of the army. <br><br>I believe that many Christians get into a lot of trouble by not being honest in their convictions. For instance, if a person goes into a workshop, or a soldier into a barracks, and if he does not fly his flag from the beginning, it will be very difficult for him to run it up afterwards. But if he immediately and boldly lets them know, &#x201c;I am a Christian, and there are certain things that I cannot do to please you, and certain other things that I cannot help doing even though they might displease you&#x201d; &#x2013; when that is clearly understood, after a while the peculiarity of the thing will be gone, and the person will be let alone. <br><br>However, if he is a little dishonest and thinks that he is going to please the world and please Christ too, he can depend on it that he is in for a rough time. If he tries the way of compromise, his life will be like that of a toad under a harrow or a fox in a dog kennel. That will never do. Come out. Show your colors. Let it be known who you are and what you are. Although your course will not be smooth, it will certainly not be half as rough as if you tried to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, which is a very difficult piece of business. <br>- Charles H.

Each felt a different part and reached a different conclusion about the nature of the elephant.<br> <br>The poet John Godfrey Saxe reported the outcome:<br> <br>And so these men of Hindustan<br> <br>Disputed loud and long,<br> <br>Each in his own opinion<br> <br>Exceeding stiff and strong,<br> <br>Though each was partly in the right<br> <br>And all were in the wrong.<br> <br>Much the way experts quarrel about diet!<br> <br>Why is it so hard to figure out the optimal diet?<br> <br>Like the blind men in the fable, diet experts begin with no clear picture of what an elephant looks like and after lifelong investigations acquire only a partial grasp of the evidence. The biomedical database PubMed contains more than 22 million articles, and a million new papers are added each year. A typical scientist reads at most a thousand papers per year. No matter how long a scientist&#x2019;s career, it&#x2019;s impossible to read more than 0.1 percent of the literature. Most of this reading has to be in the scientist&#x2019;s specialty&#x2014;a small part of the elephant.<br> <br>Adding to the problem is the complexity of human biology. We need to get many nutrients, maybe hundreds, from our food. Food contains thousands of toxins. With so many different ways food can nourish or harm us and so many different ways to assemble foods into a diet, picking out which diet is healthiest is like answering a multiple-choice test that has a billion choices. It&#x2019;s easy to go wrong.<br> <br>Looking at all this research is like looking at a disassembled jigsaw puzzle with no picture of the completed puzzle. It&#x2019;s hard to tell how to put the pieces together.<br> A Big-Picture View We Can Trust<p></p> <br>What we really need is a big-picture view&#x2014;a view of the whole elephant. We need a reliable guide to the optimal diet, a guide that gives us an approximation to the truth at the very beginning of our investigations. This approximate answer can be a lodestar that guides us through the labyrinth of details, preventing many a wrong turn.<br> <br>This is where an evolutionary perspective comes in. We know that healthy people and animals are more likely to survive the vicissitudes of life and have children and grandchildren. This means that evolution selects for healthful behaviors&#x2014;including healthful eating.<br> <br>If we&#x2019;re looking for a human diet that evolution guarantees is healthful, the place to start is with the diets of the Paleolithic. The Paleolithic was so long&#x2014;2.6 million years&#x2014;that Paleolithic man became highly optimized for the Stone Age environment. In the last 10,000 years, mutations have become much more common due to population growth,1 but most beneficial mutations have not had time to become widespread. The historical era has been a period of genetic diversification and emerging but incomplete adaptation to modern life. That means if we want an environment, diet, and lifestyle that will be healthful for all of us, we have to look back to the Paleolithic.<br>SCIENCE OF THE PHD<br>Why We Share a Paleolithic Heritage<br> <br>The Paleolithic began 2.6 million years ago with the invention of stone tools and ended 10,000 years ago with the invention of agriculture. The Paleolithic lasted a hundred thousand generations and was characterized by small populations, typically, tens or hundreds of thousands; at the end of the Paleolithic the human population was 3 million. The modern era has a large population&#x2014;7 billion today&#x2014;but evolution has had little time, less than five hundred generations, to work its magic.<br> <br>We can calculate how long it will take before every possible mutation appears in some person, somewhere. Every child has a similar number of mutations&#x2014;about 175 new point mutations among the 3 billion base pairs of the human genome.2<br> <br>�&nbsp;In the Paleolithic, with 10,000 children per generation, it would have taken 8,000 generations, or 160,000 years, for each possible mutation to occur once.<br> <br>�&nbsp;Today, with more than a billion children per generation, every possible point mutation now appears about twenty times per generation, or almost yearly.<br> <br>We can also calculate the time required for a beneficial mutation to reach &#x201c;fixation,&#x201d; or universal presence throughout humanity. This time is on the order of ln(N)/s, where N is the population size and s is the selection coefficient, a measure of how beneficial the mutation is in terms of expected number of children.3<br> <br>�&nbsp;In the Paleolithic, a mutation that raised the probability of having an extra child by only 0.1 percent would have reached fixation in 460,000 years. So a mutation with selective advantage of 0.1 percent would have occurred within the first 160,000 years of the Paleolithic, then become universal 460,000 years later&#x2014;long before the Paleolithic was over.<br> <br>�&nbsp;In the modern era, a similar mutation would occur every year but would require 200,000 years to reach fixation. The modern era is less than 10,000 years old, however, so few recently mutated genes have had time to become universal. As a result, our genetic adaptation to the new environment of modern life&#x2014;agricultural foods, city living, the presence of governments and complex institutions&#x2014;is incomplete. And human genetic diversity is greater than ever before.<br> <br>Because mutations that would remove our adaptation to Paleolithic diets have had little time to spread through the population, it is likely that nearly everyone is extremely well adapted to Paleolithic diets. The same cannot be said for modern diets.|Perfect Health Diet 2<p></p> The Paleolithic Diet<p></p> <br> <br>�&nbsp;Eat real food: recently living plants and animals.<br> <br>�&nbsp;Eat mostly plants&#x2014;but low-carb!<br> <br>�&nbsp;Among plant foods, favor in-ground starches.<br> <br>�&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t be afraid to eat fat! Hunter-gatherers flourished on a fat-rich diet.<br><br>The premise of &#x201c;Paleo&#x201d; diets is that foods hunted and gathered by our Paleolithic (&#x201c;Old Stone Age&#x201d;) ancestors represent the healthiest human way of eating, while agriculturally-produced foods may be dangerous to well-being.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s solid evidence backing this idea. Direct evidence for the superiority of Paleolithic diets comes from archaeological studies of ancient skeletons. These studies tell us that until the modern era, with our reduced rates of infectious disease, the Paleolithic was the healthiest epoch of human history.<br> <br>Studies of animals also show that &#x201c;wild&#x201d; diets are the healthiest. For example:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Thirty-two percent of pet cats and dogs are obese,1 but obesity is rare among wild wolves and tigers. It&#x2019;s not only pets: feral rats living in cities and eating discarded human food have grown increasingly obese in parallel with the human obesity epidemic.2<br> <br>�&nbsp;Zoo-born elephants live only half as long as elephants living wild in parks such as Amboseli National Park, Kenya.3 Zoo elephants also have much higher rates of obesity than wild elephants. Elephants make a great comparison animal, because they are rarely subject to predation in the wild.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s the &#x201c;wild&#x201d; human diet? Presumably, the diet obtained the same way wild animals obtain their food: by hunting and foraging in the manner of our Paleolithic ancestors.<br><br>READER REPORTS: A Cure for IBS<br> <br>I&#x2019;m 62 and have suffered, along with anyone who gets near me, with IBS for the past 25 or so years, and have tried just about every supplement to alleviate the condition without success.

Paleolithic humans were tall and slender; cavities and signs of malnutrition or stress in bones were rare; muscle attachments were strong, and there was an absence of skeletal evidence of infections or malignancy.4<br> <br>The adoption of farming in the Neolithic radically changed the diet, and with it came a dramatic loss of health. Farmers needed crops that yielded many calorie-rich seeds from each seed planted, so the harvest could feed the farmer&#x2019;s family for a year and supply seeds for sowing in the spring. This required a turn of the diet to grains and legumes&#x2014;foods that, as we shall see, are toxic.<br> <br>After the adoption of agriculture, stature lessened; smaller tendon attachments show that muscles weakened; bone and teeth pathologies, such as cavities and osteoporosis, became common; hypoplasias show that periods of malnutrition were common; and signs of infections and inflammation became common.<br><br>SCIENCE OF THE PHD<br>The Neolithic Decline<br> <br>A large number of journal articles, anthropology Ph.D. theses, and books discuss the collapse of health that is visible with the adoption of cereal grain agriculture.5 A few tidbits:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Average height dropped, bottoming out at about five feet, three inches for men, five feet for women around 3000 B.C.&#x2014;about five inches shorter than in the Early Upper Paleolithic.6<br> <br>�&nbsp;Bones from the Neolithic site of Ganj Dareh in Israel, studied by the anthropologist Anagnostis Agelarakis, showed hypoplasias on the teeth, indicative of malnutrition when young; signs of ear infections and gum inflammation; broken or fractured bones; and arthritis. Those who survived childhood struggled to reach middle age.7<br> <br>�&nbsp;Nine of sixteen Bronze Age mummies&#x2014;and seven of the eight of people who died after age 45&#x2014;in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, Cairo, had atherosclerosis.8<br><br>The drop in stature persisted throughout the agricultural era until modern times. Only in the twentieth century, with rising wealth and the elimination of many infectious diseases, did humans regain Paleolithic stature.<br> <br>So Paleolithic diets were quite healthful&#x2014;agricultural diets, not so much.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d better look into what those healthy Stone Age hunter-gatherers were eating!<br> Paleolithic Plant Foods: Savanna Starches<p></p> <br>Many people assume that our distant ancestors resembled chimps and gorillas&#x2014;forest-dwelling apes who ate fruit. That&#x2019;s a mistake.<br> <br>Our ancestors had a long association with open woodlands and tree-spotted grasslands. Where the fossils of human ancestors have been found, tree cover was generally less than 40 percent, sometimes as low as 5 percent.9<br> <br>Fossils testify that our Paleolithic ancestors lived in open, grassy terrain. Fossil hominids lack the stiff spines and long powerful arms of forest-dwelling apes, and appear to have spent much of their time walking bipedally as grassland dwellers do.10 Ape bipedalism has a long history. Ardipithecus ramidus, which dates from about 4.4 million years ago, spent a significant amount of time walking bipedally,11 as did Oreopithecus bambolii, whose fossils date from 10 to 7 million years ago.12 Another bipedal hominoid dates to 21.6 million years ago.13 Very possibly the common human-chimp ancestor was a bipedal ape living in open terrain, and chimps and gorillas adapted to the forest after they diverged from the human line.<br> <br>Not only did our hominid ancestors live in wooded grasslands, their food came from grasslands too. This has been proven by a clever method&#x2014;&#x201c;isotope signatures&#x201d; of fossilized bones. Combined with the structure of hominid teeth, this evidence tells us that our ancestors were eating savanna tubers, roots, and corms&#x2014;foods similar to our modern potato and taro. They had invented the digging stick and were eating starch!<br><br>SCIENCE OF THE PHD<br>How We Know Paleolithic Hominids<br>Ate In-Ground Starches<br> <br>Carbon comes in heavy (carbon-13) and light (carbon-12) forms, and grasses and sedges (&#x201c;C4 plants&#x201d;) incorporate relatively more carbon-13 than other plants. So the carbon-13 to carbon-12 ratio in a skeleton tells us what fraction of the creature&#x2019;s food was obtained from grassland plants or animals that ate grassland plants.14<br> <br>There is considerable variability, but in general grassland plants predominated in the diet of Paleolithic and earlier hominids. This created a puzzle, known as the &#x201c;C4 conundrum.&#x201d; Hominids such as Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus did not have the right kind of teeth for eating grasses and were not thought to be major hunters of grazing animals, yet their bones show that they got their carbon from grasses. The resolution of the puzzle: those apes were getting their dietary carbon from C4 plant underground storage organs&#x2014;tubers and corms similar to the modern potato and taro.15<br><br>This emphasis on starchy roots, tubers, corms, and rhizomes continued throughout the Paleolithic. Food residues from Upper Paleolithic sites dated to 30,000 years ago show that the grinding of starchy roots and rhizomes into flours and foodstuffs was a common practice.16 Microfossils on Neanderthal teeth from around 44,000 years ago show evidence of the consumption of many roots and tubers, some of which show evidence of cooking.17 Neanderthal consumption of starchy plants goes back at least 250,000 years.18<br> <br>Modern hunter-gatherers who live in environments that lack starchy plants all trade for starches produced elsewhere. The anthropologist Thomas Headland proposed that it would not be possible for humans to survive in forest environments without such trade; this was debated as the &#x201c;wild yam question.&#x201d;19<br><br>READER REPORTS: Weight Loss, Improved Energy<br> <br>I am in the middle of the wardrobe crisis that I&#x2019;ve been waiting to have for ten years: all my clothes are too big.

That&#x2019;s a good thing, since the drop on the scale was a side effect of lifestyle changes that have left me with more stamina and energy than I had when I was 20.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not an exaggeration to say that the Perfect Health Diet changed my life.<br> <br>&#x2014;Jennifer Fulwiler<br><br>A final line of evidence&#x2014;genetics&#x2014;supports the idea that our Paleolithic ancestors ate starches. Chimps have two copies of the gene for salivary amylase, the enzyme that digests starches. Humans worldwide average seven copies of the gene; aboriginal peoples eating low-starch diets, such as the rain forest&#x2013;dwelling BiAka and Mbuti pygmies of the Congo Basin, average 5.4 copies.20 A plausible interpretation is that our Paleolithic ancestors ate enough starch to reach 5 to 6 copies of the amylase gene and that subsequent evolution since the Neolithic invention of cereal grain agriculture has increased the amylase copy number a bit further.<br> Paleolithic Animal Foods<p></p> <br>The Paleolithic began with the invention of stone tools about 2.6 million years ago. These tools were used to hunt animals, tear meat, and cut bones to reach the marrow. Bone marrow consumption is attested from 1.9 million years ago.21 The pursuit of marrow, which is nearly all fat, shows that animal fats were a sought-after part of the early Paleolithic diet.<br> <br>By 1.75 million years ago, ancestral Homo had spread to northern latitudes, where plant foods are relatively scarce. It is likely these northern hominids were eating a meat-based diet.<br> <br>By 40,000 years ago, we can tell that Neanderthals (hunting herbivores such as mammoths) and humans (hunting many species with an emphasis on fish) were top-level carni...</p><h2>Nancy Drew Diaries (Boxed Set): Curse of the Arctic Star; Strangers on a Train; Mystery of the Midnight Rider; Once Upon a Thriller</h2><p><b>Think you know Nancy Drew?

Now seventeen, Mary must put her training to the test. Disguised as a lady&#x2019;s companion, she infiltrates a merchant&#x2019;s home in hopes of finding clues to the whereabouts of his missing cargo ships. But the household is full of deceptions, and there is no one to trust. . . . Or is there? Packed with suspense and evoking gritty Victorian backstreets, this breezy mystery marks the debut of a detective who lives by her wits while uncovering secrets &#x2014; including those of her own past.</p><p>Y. S. Lee has a PhD in Victorian literature and culture and says her research inspired her to write A SPY IN THE HOUSE, &#34;a totally unrealistic, completely fictitious antidote to the fate that would otherwise swallow a girl like Mary Quinn.&#34; Y. S. Lee lives in Ontario, Canada.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Mary Quinn, a scrappy 12-year-old orphan and accomplished thief in Victorian London, is saved from the gallows by a stranger and taken to Miss Scrimshaw's Academy for Girls, an institution dedicated to turning out strong, independent, educated young women. Though reluctant at first, she accepts the challenge and eventually becomes a teacher herself. At 17, she is recruited by the mistresses of the school to join a covert group of female spies known as The Agency. Her first assignment involves posing as a lady's companion to the daughter of a man suspected of fraud and smuggling. She carries out her investigation at night and during stolen moments, but soon finds that she is not the only one on the case. Is James Easton a friend or foe? A dramatic rescue from a burning building reveals the true villain but leaves other questions unanswered. Lee fills the story with classic elements of Victorian mystery and melodrama. Class differences, love gone awry, racial discrimination, London's growing pains in the 1850s, and the status of women in society are all addressed. Historical details are woven seamlessly into the plot, and descriptive writing allows readers to be part of each scene. Readers who liked Phillip Pullman's <i>The Ruby in the Smoke</i> (Knopf, 2008) will find similar elements in this new series starter.&#x2014;<i>Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

Or do we know these things? Peter Leithart weighs these claims and finds them wanting. And what's more, in focusing on these historical mirages we have failed to notice the true significance of Constantine and Rome baptized. For beneath the surface of this contested story there emerges a deeper narrative of the end of Roman sacrifice--a tectonic shift in the political theology of an empire--and with far-reaching implications. In this probing and informative book Peter Leithart examines the real Constantine, weighs the charges against Constantinianism, and sets the terms for a new conversation about this pivotal emperor and the Christendom that emerged.</p><p><strong>Peter J. Leithart</strong> is a senior fellow at New Saint Andrews College, Moscow, Idaho, and a pastor of Trinity Reformed Church in Moscow. He is the author of several books, including <em>Deep Exegesis: The Mystery of Reading Scripture</em> and <em>Solomon Among the Postmoderns.</em>". . . this work should serve as a welcome redress of the often one-sided debate regarding Constantine and Constantinianism." (Britton W. Norvell, Restoration Quarterly, 55:1 (2013))<br><br>"This book is a must read for anyone assaying to deal with Constantine in the foreseeable future; it is a valuable correction of the tendentious views that frame the first Christian emperor. Leithart?s work is a welcome contribution to Constantine scholarship and should find its place in responsible library collections. Scholars will want to get their own copy, and many classes will be enriched by the addition of this book to the list of required readings." (James R. Payton, Jr., Calvin Theological Journal, November 2012)<br><br>"In <em>Defending Constantine</em> [Leithart] has done the historian, theologian, church leader, and layman a great service by providing an enjoyably readable historical-theological-conceptual look at this critical era of church history." (Michael Philliber, Touchstone, January/February 2012)<br><br>"<em>Defending Constantine</em> demonstrates the enduring relevance of the "Constantinian moment" of the fourth century. While recent scholarship has focused mainly on the negative results, Leithart swings the pendulum back, reminding us of all the good that God brought about from this contested period of history." (Trevin Wax, Christianity Today, March 2011)<br><br>"Here is an excellent scholarly and fair treatment of Constantine." (Christian News, November 15, 2010)<br><br>"This erudite work will be of interest to academic seminarians and theologians, as well as those seeking a historically sound Christian interpretation of Constantine." (Matthew Connor Sullivan, Library Journal, December 2010)<br><br>"Leithart has written an important book that does more than help us to better understand the complex human being who bore the name of Constantine. . . As a pacifist I could not want a better conversation partner than Peter Leithart." (Stanley Hauerwas, Christian Century, October 19, 2010)<br><br>"For a generation that thinks it approves of those who challenge the conventional wisdom, it can come as quite a shock when someone actually does it. In this book, Peter Leithart takes up the daunting challenge of defending Constantine, and he does it with biblical grace, deep wisdom, profound learning and scholarship that has let the clutch out. This is a magnificent book." (Douglas Wilson, senior fellow of theology, New Saint Andrews College, Idaho)<br><br>"An excellent writer with a flair for the dramatic, Peter Leithart is also one of the most incisive current thinkers on questions of theology and politics. In this book, Leithart helpfully complicates Christian history, and thereby helps theologians recover the riches of more than a millennium of Christian life too easily dismissed as 'Constantinian.' If the Holy Spirit did not simply go on holiday during that period, we must find ways to appreciate Christendom. Any worthwhile political theology today cannot fail to take Leithart's argument seriously." (William T. Cavanaugh, Research Professor, Center for World Catholicism and Intercultural Theology, DePaul University, Chicago)<br><br>"There have been of late a splurge of populist history books damning Constantine the Great as the villain of the piece. Almost without exception they have drawn their picture of this most complex and complicated of late-antique Roman emperors from secondhand, clich�d and hackneyed books of an older generation, adding their own clich�s in the process. Constantine has been sketched luridly, as the man who corrupted Christianity either by financial or military means. At long last we have here, in Peter Leithart, a writer who knows how to tell a lively story but is also no mean shakes as a scholarly historian. This intelligent and sensitive treatment of one of the great military emperors of Rome is a trustworthy entr�e into Roman history that loses none of the romance and rambunctiousness of the events of the era of the civil war, but which also explains why Constantine matters: why he was important to the ancient world, why he matters to the development of Christianity (a catalyst in its movement from small sect to world-embracing cultural force). It does not whitewash or damn on the basis of a preset ideology, but it certainly does explain why Constantine gained from the Christians the epithet 'The Great.' For setting the record straight, and for providing a sense of the complicated lay of the land, this book comes most highly recommended." (John A. McGuckin, Columbia University)</p><h2>Start Here Now: An Open-Hearted Guide to the Path and Practice of Meditation</h2><p><b>A concise, jargon-free guide to learning what Buddhist meditation is&#x2014;and isn't&#x2014;with advice on how to start a meditation practice.</b><br><br>If you want to meditate but have no idea where to begin, this book by best-selling author and Buddhist teacher Susan Piver will help you: it contains everything you need to know to start a meditation practice and, even more important, to continue one.

Before Mary was a children's book author and illustrator, she knitted designer sweaters, interpreted for the deaf, and painted signs. Some of her hobbies include gardening, knitting, reading, and, of course, drawing! She has illustrated MY CHAIR, A GRAND OLD TREE, and THE NUTCRACKER DOLL for Arthur A. Levine Books. Mary lives in Boston with her husband and two children.<br>"'Once there was a grand old tree.' So begins this lovely, spare story of the life cycle of a dogwood tree, with nary a human in sight to sentimentalize (or speed up) the process. Indeed, through all four seasons, this ever-changing grand old tree is home to birds, squirrels and bugs. She flowers, bears red fruit, loses and regrows her leaves, sows seeds and has many children, spread far and wide. Over the years, she basks in the sun, bathes in the rain, sways in the breeze and dances in the wind until she can sway and dance no more. When she's very old, she falls over and dies, but as a log she still provides a home to many creatures and her offspring keep on keepin' on. DePalma's delicate tissue-paper collage and watercolor illustrations (with miscellaneous fibers) are winningly simple and her big-eyed animals are sweetly comical, especially the fruit-munching squirrel buddies and the fat, leaf-sailing ladybugs. A winsome introduction to the cycles of life." -- <i>Kirkus</i><br>Booklist 11/15/05<br><br>"For many years a tree flourishes. It shelters birds, squirrels, and insects while flowering, bearing fruit, shedding leaves, and providing seeds that grow into many new trees. After the old tree dies, it still provides a home to animals and insects as it slowly decomposes. Meanwhile, its offspring grow and flourish, 'home to many creatures, just like the grand old tree.' The simple text conveys the tree's life and death in a matter-of-fact way, but with well-chosen words that are poetic in the economy of their expression and the precision of their imagery. On one page, words combine with an illustration to form a concrete poem, with the text forming the shape of the trunk and the ground and the picture representing the tree's crown, the sky, and a bird. Neither sentimental nor unfeeling, this appealing picture book offers an appreciation of the cycle of life through a story that is accessible to young children." -- <i>Booklist</i><br>"The life cycle of a tree is introduced through deceptively simple text and art. DePalma's short, measured phrases turn facts about a tree's growth, &#x201c;her&#x201d; seasonal changes, and the home &#x201c;she&#x201d; provides to a variety of creatures into an ode to an often-overlooked part of the natural world. The fact that the tree is given a female persona makes &#x201c;her&#x201d; seem that much more alive than if &#x201c;she&#x201d; were an &#x201c;it.&#x201d; &#x201c;Her roots sank deep into the earth, her arms reached high into the sky.&#x201d; The art superbly complements the writing. The use of white space to set off the child-inspired illustration style allows the words to stand out and makes the entire design clear and crisp. The tree's demise on a winter evening is particularly striking. Perfect for storyhour and for beginning readers, this book will make a grand addition to most collections." -- <i>School Library Journal</i><br><br></p><h2>A Documentary History of Religion in America</h2><p><p><i>Up-to-date one-volume edition of a standard text</i></p><p>For decades students and scholars have turned to the two-volume&nbsp;<i>Documentary History of Religion in America&nbsp;</i>for access to the most significant primary sources relating to American religious history from the sixteenth century to the present.

She would have called the police or, at the very least, screamed if he hadn&#x2019;t been so damned beautiful.</p><p>Instead, without so much as a blink, she fumbled for the electric kettle and poured boiling water over the loose tea leaves in the silver strainer. Quite a bit of water missed the mug, went onto the granite countertop, and ran down to the tile floor, but she didn&#x2019;t notice.</p><p>It was so early that it wasn&#x2019;t yet daylight, and she hadn&#x2019;t bothered to turn on the kitchen lights. But then he&#x2019;d turned on the porch lights, and in the misty morning, as she looked through the screen door, it was almost as though he were on a stage.</p><p>He&#x2019;d dropped his T-shirt and sweatpants on the stone path, then, totally nude and facing Casey, he walked up the three steps, his full male glory in view. He came straight toward her, as though he meant to enter the house.</p><p>Casey had just woken up, and when she first saw him, she thought she was still asleep and having the best dream of her life. Not only was his body beautiful, but so was his face. Hair, eyes, beard stubble, truly luscious lips. His skin was a dark golden color all over, and he had long, sleek muscles. His hair was long, down his neck, and in the overhead light it was so black that it seemed to glisten almost blue.</p><p>When he got to the porch, he didn&#x2019;t open the screen door and come inside. Instead, he turned so she had a glorious view of his side.</p><p>Lord! Pecs. Abs. The curve of his backside, thighs like an Olympic skater&#x2019;s.</p><p>Casey managed to blink a few times. Surely she was asleep. Surely he couldn&#x2019;t be&nbsp;<i>real</i>.</p><p>He seemed to be doing something to the wall, and seconds later it started raining. That made sense. The deity who controlled the heavens&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>look like this man.</p><p>But, no, it was an outdoor shower that seemed to be attached to her little guesthouse. She hadn&#x2019;t noticed that it was there&#x2014;for the few months she&#x2019;d been in town, it had been winter. But yesterday had been so warm that she&#x2019;d opened every door and window to let out the heat of her cooking. When she at last went to bed, the kitchen had been so hot that she&#x2019;d just hooked the screen door and left the room open to the breezes.</p><p>She picked up her mug of tea and sipped it while she watched him lather himself with soap.</p><p>There was a tall stool near her, and without taking her eyes off him, she felt for it and sat down. As he ran his hands over his body, she was even more sure that she was dreaming. And she was just as sure that if she took her eyes off him she&#x2019;d wake up.</p><p>She watched him soap his legs, and between them, then he moved upward. He had such trouble reaching the entire width of his back that Casey had thoughts of slipping out of her pajamas and joining him.</p><p>&#x201c;Could I help?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d ask. He wouldn&#x2019;t say a word. He&#x2019;d just hand her the soap and she&#x2019;d get busy.</p><p>Of course, she could use some cleaning too, so he would do her back. Or front. Or wherever he wanted to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it was the way it was dark where she was sitting and so very light where he was that made it all seem like a movie. She sipped her tea and watched him, dreamily smiling at the scene.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been working in the kitchen until midnight and it was very early now. Kit said he wanted the food at the playhouse by eight, and she took that to mean he wanted it set up and ready to serve. Last night she&#x2019;d called her brother Josh to ask if he&#x2019;d please, please find some tables for her. &#x201c;Use sawhorses or tree stumps, whatever your great manliness can find,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said in the voicemail she left for him.&#x201c; Just so I have a place to put all this food. Kit said he&#x2019;s expecting half the town to show up for the auditions. Double please? I&#x2019;ll save you some of those cream-filled doughnut holes you like so much.&#x201d; She said the last in a voice as cajoling as she could make it. Considering that she&#x2019;d been on her feet for fourteen hours, she wondered if she sounded more pathetic than persuasive.</p><p>But looking at the beautiful naked man was making up for yesterday. He was rinsing off now. He reached up to the shower- head on the wall, pulled it down, and began spraying water over his entire gorgeous body.</p><p>Casey held the mug of tea to her lips, frozen in place. All she could do was stare. His long hair was wet, plastered to his skull. His profile showed his strong features&#x2014;and something about it seemed familiar.</p><p>He turned off the water, then looked around for something. He needs a towel, she thought, and it ran through her mind that she could open the door and hand him one.</p><p>When he stepped toward the house as though he meant to enter, her heart seemed to stop. She was more fully awake now and she was aware that she&#x2019;d just spied on a man taking a shower. Not exactly a polite thing to do. She certainly wouldn&#x2019;t like it done to her!</p><p>When he put his hand on the door handle, Casey&#x2019;s heart started pounding. She didn&#x2019;t dare move or he would see her.</p><p>He dropped his hand and went down the steps, picked up his sweatpants, and put them on&#x2014;and she let out her breath. He would never know. Good!</p><p>But as he reached for his shirt, her cellphone rang. It had been charging and she&#x2019;d forgotten it was on the counter. It kept ringing as she reached for it, then she fumbled and hit speakerphone just as it went to voicemail.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, little sis, I used a broadsword to cut down a couple of oaks and hacked out some tables. But I also borrowed a couple from the church. If you want me to pick you and your kettles up in my truck, let me know. If I don&#x2019;t hear from you, I&#x2019;ll see you at eight.&#x201d; He hung up.</p><p>Casey hadn&#x2019;t moved, nor had she taken her eyes off the man. When the phone rang, he&#x2019;d dropped the shirt and turned to look at the door.</p><p>She was almost sure he saw her. She had on her white pajamas, the ones her mom had given her with the print of the dish running away with the spoon and the cow jumping over the moon. Too young for her, and they clung much too tightly to her curvy figure, but they were oh so comforting.</p><p>It had grown lighter outside and she knew she was probably visible inside the dark room. But maybe not. Maybe she could sneak upstairs and pretend she hadn&#x2019;t seen him.</p><p>As quickly as she could, she put her mug down and slid off the stool.</p><p>But she wasn&#x2019;t fast enough. He bounded up the steps and reached the door in seconds. When he tried to open it, the inside hook held.</p><p>Thinking she had a reprieve, Casey took a step toward the living room, but a sound made her turn back.</p><p>The man, naked from hip bones up, put his fist through the screen and unfastened the hook.</p><p>Okay, now she was scared. This man was big and he looked furious. She glanced at her cellphone but it was between her and him. Her little house was set in eleven acres of garden and woodland. If she screamed, no one would hear her.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get it all down?&#x201d; He stepped closer to her.</p><p>His voice was deep&#x2014;and menacing. Maybe if she ran she could reach the front door and get out. But then what? The only house nearby was the big one, and it was empty.</p><p>She put her hands into fists at her sides, took a deep breath, and faced him. Minutes before, his size, the muscles, the sheer masculinity of him had been enticing, but now they seemed threatening. She didn&#x2019;t think she could escape him, but maybe if she didn&#x2019;t back down he&#x2019;d go away.</p><p>&#x201c;I live here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re trespassing.&#x201d;</p><p>He stopped only three feet away. &#x201c;Like hell you do! Who do you work for? Where is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Casey took a step back. What a voice he had! Loud and deep. And what he was asking was thoroughly puzzling. &#x201c;I work for myself. I cater and do private parties.&#x201d;</p><p>He took another step toward her.&#x201c; And this is a sideline? Where are you hiding it?&#x201d;</p><p>Confusion was replacing her fear. &#x201c;What is &#x2018;it&#x2019;? What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>He picked up her cellphone, the charging cord falling away. &#x201c;Please tell me you didn&#x2019;t use&nbsp;<i>this</i>! I think I deserve better than a mobile phone.&#x201d; He put the phone back on the counter, then turned, his eyes roaming up and down her.</p><p>Casey knew she was looking far from her best. Who wanted a gorgeous man to see her wearing pajamas that were perfect for a five-year-old? And her hair was a rat&#x2019;s nest of tangles and probably full of flour and raspberry jam. She&#x2019;d collapsed last night, not bothering to shower.</p><p>Maybe it was pride, but all sense of fear vanished. She put her shoulders back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are but I want you out of my house. Now!&#x201d; She grabbed her phone. &#x201c;I think the sheriff would like to hear about a man stripping on&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>porch and tearing out&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>screen to get inside&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>house and threatening me. Unless you want to be in handcuffs, I suggest you leave immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood there staring at her, saying nothing, but looking shocked. He opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it. Turning, he left the house, the door slamming behind him.</p><p>For a few moments, Casey stood where she was, her nails cutting into her palms as she watched him leave. He didn&#x2019;t stop to pick up his shirt but kept going, turned right, and moved out of sight.</p><p>Suddenly she felt exhausted. She made it into the living room and fell down onto the couch, her heart pounding in her ears. With her head back, she tried to use her breathing to calm herself.</p><p>The man had been so very angry!</p><p>When Kit had given her the little guesthouse to live in, she&#x2019;d thought it was perfect. It had once been the kitchen of an old Virginia plantation, and the huge fireplace that had been used for cooking was in the living room. Years ago someone had added to the building, putting an excellent kitchen to one side and a bed- room and bath upstairs. There was even an herb garden just outside.</p><p>Kit had asked if she minded being so isolated, but Casey said no, that she loved it. The Big House&#x2014;which had been renovated and decorated before she arrived&#x2014;was locked tight and empty. For six years before she came to Summer Hill, she&#x2019;d been the head chef of one of the busiest restaurants in D.C. After the noise and controlled chaos of that place, the quiet of the old plantation had been bliss.</p><p>But this morning had turned scary.</p><p>She was beginning to calm down, and she needed to think about what she was going to do now. All in all, she thought she should call the sheriff and report what had happened&#x2014;including her embarrassing voyeurism.</p><p>She was still holding her phone and she saw that she had a voicemail from Kit. As she touched the screen, her hand was shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Casey, my dear,&#x201d; Kit&#x2019;s strong voice said, &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s late and I hope you&#x2019;ve gone to bed, but I just wanted to tell you that the owner of Tattwell has returned. I know you think I own the place and I apologize for the subterfuge, but my cousin swore me to secrecy. Still, I feel I should warn you in case you see a couple of strange men on the grounds. The owner is Tatton Landers and he&#x2019;s with his best friend, Jack Worth. They are both very nice young men, so I hope you&#x2019;ll welcome them. I must go. I&#x2019;ll see you at the auditions.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey listened to the message twice to try to get all the information it contained. Jack Worth? she thought. That was the name of an actor she really liked. Her last boyfriend had been a fiend for his movies and had all the DVDs. They had never missed a new Jack Worth movie.</p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t the man on the porch.</p><p>Casey took a breath. This was ridiculous! Jack Worth was a common name. Kit couldn&#x2019;t have been referring to the actor.</p><p>On impulse, she tapped the other name, Tatton Landers, into her phone&#x2019;s search engine, and it redirected her. There he was. The man she&#x2019;d watched showering on her porch had thousands of photos on the Internet. Most of them were in period costume: a knight in armor, tight Regency trousers, a leather jerkin like Robin Hood would wear.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she said aloud. &#x201c;Tate Landers.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d never seen one of his movies, but a friend of hers used to talk about him. She loved romantic movies and went to all of them. They&#x2019;d never interested Casey so she&#x2019;d only half-listened to what her friend was saying&#x2014;and had teased her friend about them.&#x201c; You have a Ph.D. in psychology but you drool over some actor who says, &#x2018;Oh, Charity Goodheart, your eyes are like emeralds. Please be mine.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t get it, do you?&#x201d; her friend said.&#x201c; We live in a world of metrosexuals. Tate isn&#x2019;t like that. He throws women over the saddle of a horse and tells them to shut up.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey was aghast. &#x201c;What would you say to one of your clients if she told you her boyfriend did that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d give her the number of a center for abused women and make sure she went. But that&#x2019;s real; Tate is fantasy.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey shook her head at her friend. &#x201c;This guy is an actor. In real life he probably wears pink shirts and gets his eyebrows waxed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not Tate! I read that he&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Casey had thrown up her hands. Her friend had tried to get her to go to romantic movies, but she wouldn&#x2019;t. With her workload she had little time off and she wasn&#x2019;t going to waste it on some drippy saga.</p><p>Now it seemed that she was living in a house on property owned by some big-deal movie star&#x2014;who hated her.</p><p>And rightfully so, Casey thought. It was one thing to watch some half-naked guy mow the lawn, but when people spied on public figures they often ended up in court. And went to prison.</p><p>What was it he&#x2019;d said? &#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d; And &#x201c;Please tell me you didn&#x2019;t use&nbsp;<i>this</i>! I think I deserve better than a mobile phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He thought I was photographing him,&#x201d; she said aloud. When he thought she&#x2019;d snapped the pictures on a cellphone, his ego had been hurt. In spite of the gravity of the situation, she couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. No wonder he ran away at the mention of the sheriff. Wouldn&#x2019;t the tabloids love a photo of the romantic hero in handcuffs?</p><p>Casey stood up.&#x201c; I have to fix this,&#x201d; she whispered. She needed to apologize and explain, then apologize some more.</p><p>She looked at the clock on the mantel. It was still early, so she could take about an hour to do what she did best. She was going to cook something wonderful and take it to him. She&#x2019;d use her best I&#x2019;m-sorry voice to make him forgive her. And she&#x2019;d assure him that she had entered the room just as the phone rang, so she&#x2019;d only seen him with his shirt off.</p><p>That&#x2019;s good, she thought. A few lies, some of her honey-glazed chicken, and a good strong mimosa, and maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t kick her out of her very comfortable little house. Or put her in jail.</p><p>She had a plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>ACT ONE, SCENE TWO</b></p><p><b>Elizabeth doesn&#x2019;t tempt Darcy</b></p><p>An hour later, Casey arrived at the Big House&#x2014;as everyone in town referred to it&#x2014;with food. She&#x2019;d used some of what she&#x2019;d already prepared for Kit&#x2019;s group, then added a few things. In an insulated container she had strands of slow-roasted, honey-glazed chicken and sweet-potato hash with fried eggs on top. She&#x2019;d buttered freshly made bread and grilled it.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t easy to think about what she had to do.

Are the Thirty-nine Articles of any relevance today? Anglicanism, according to Jim Packer, possesses &#34;the truest, wisest and potentially richest heritage in all Christendom&#34; with the Thirty-nine Articles at its heart. They catch the substance and spirit of biblical Christianity superbly well, and also provide and excellent model of how to confess the faith in a divided Christendom. In this Latimer Study, Packer aims to show how the sixteenth century Articles should be viewed in the twenty-first century, and how they can enrich the faith of Anglicans in general and of Anglican evangelicals in particular. He demonstrates why the Articles must once again be given a voice within the church, not merely as an historical curiosity but an authoritative doctrinal statement. A thought-provoking appendix by Roger Beckwith offers seventeen Supplementary Articles, addressing theological issues which have come into prominence since the original Articles were composed. This booklet, first published more than twenty years ago, remains much in demand and as timely as ever. It has proved on of the most popular and enduring Latimer Studies, and is now issued in a second edition. Jim Packer is Board of Governors&#39; Professor of Theology at Regent College, Vancouver. Amongst his many best-selling books are &#39;Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God&#39; (1961), &#39;Knowing God&#39; (1973), &#39;Keep in Step with the Spirit&#39; (1984), and &#39;Among God&#39;s Giants&#39; (1991). Roger Beckwith was librarian and warden of Latimer House, Oxford, for more than thirty years.

Maybe before. Exponentially improving technologies such as solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous (self-driving) cars will disrupt and sweep away the energy and transportation industries as we know it. The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of rocks. It ended because a disruptive technology ushered in the Bronze Age. The era of centralized, command-and-control, extraction-resource-based energy sources (oil, gas, coal and nuclear) will not end because we run out of petroleum, natural gas, coal, or uranium. It will end because these energy sources, the business models they employ, and the products that sustain them will be disrupted by superior technologies, product architectures, and business models. The same Silicon Valley ecosystem that created bit-based technologies that have disrupted atom-based industries is now creating bit- and electron-based technologies that will disrupt atom-based energy industries. This is a technology-based disruption reminiscent of how the cell phone, Internet, and personal computer swept away industries such as landline telephony, publishing, and mainframe computers. Just like those technology disruptions flipped the architecture of information and brought abundant, cheap and participatory information, the clean disruption will flip the architecture of energy and bring abundant, cheap and participatory energy. Just like those previous technology disruptions, the clean disruption is inevitable and will be swift. The industrial age of energy and transportation is already giving way to an information technology and knowledge-based energy and transportation era.</p><p></p><h2>My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag . . . and Other Things You Can&#39;t Ask Martha</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br><br>&#x201c;Wise and funny. . . .

Heck, even I&#x2019;ve seen a mouse scurrying through my kitchen, and I&#x2019;m a Clean Person. To be fair, it was a mouse of the field-ish variety, and my downstairs neighbors had just tilled the backyard in order to do their summer planting, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure Fievel was running all about the place because his home had been disrupted. At least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to tell people, and if you don&#x2019;t toe the party line on this one, I won&#x2019;t tell you how to clean that burnt rice off the bottom of the only pan you own. So there!</p><p>Right, so let&#x2019;s talk kitchens: they&#x2019;re such great places&#x2014;the heart of the home! But also? Woof, kitchens can get gross, can&#x2019;t they?? Grease splatters, spilled crumbs, overflowing garbage, the leaning tower of dishes in your sink&#x2014;and those are the everyday problems, right? What about when mold engulfs your leftovers? (If that&#x2019;s an everyday problem for you, please don&#x2019;t tell me, okay? I don&#x2019;t know if my heart can take it.) Or when your freezer ices over such that it poses a realistic threat to the Titanic? Or when your husband decides to brew his own ginger beer and the glass growler he stored it in explodes from the pressure created by the fermentation process, leaving your kitchen covered in glass shards and sticky ginger beer? (This is a real thing that happened, by the way. The solution? Ammonia. And heavy-duty rubber gloves because ouch ouch be careful out there, that glass is pernicious!) </p><p>So now that you possess the very important knowledge of how to clean ginger beer from your cabinets, let&#x2019;s back it up a bit and cover some basics. Starting with how to hard clean a kitchen.</p><p>Or maybe I should start with an explanation of what I mean when I say &#x201c;hard clean a kitchen&#x201d;? Yes, let&#x2019;s start there.</p><p>In the industry, we differentiate forms of kitchen cleaning using the terms daily clean, hard clean, and the full monty hard clean. Okay that&#x2019;s a lie, there&#x2019;s no &#x201c;industry&#x201d; of people like me, and we don&#x2019;t have terms and conferences and such, but oh, would that we did. Anyway! Those are just the terms I use, and I like &#x2019;em, so I&#x2019;m gonna keep &#x2019;em!</p><p>Right, so!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Daily Clean</p><p>These are, it will surprise you not to learn, the things you should do on a daily basis, allowing for adjustments if you&#x2019;re a person who doesn&#x2019;t use his or her kitchen every day. The basics are this:</p><p>� Wash the dishes</p><p>� Wipe down the counters</p><p>� Put all foodstuffs away and throw any garbage in the trash can</p><p>� Deal with any disasters as they happen</p><p>The idea is to establish a baseline of kitchen chores that allow the space to remain tidy and uninviting to critters and other pests. And, I mean, that&#x2019;s not too much, is it? You can wash a few dishes and give your counters a wiping without wanting to die from the crushing burden of it all, right??</p><p>That last bullet point, though . . . you&#x2019;ll want to know more about it, won&#x2019;t you? It is a truism that the longer you pretend that a mess doesn&#x2019;t exist, the harder it will be and the more time it will take to clean up. It&#x2019;s completely understandable to find yourself with a spilled container of leftovers in the fridge, or a pot of tomato sauce that boiled over onto your stove, and just say, &#x201c;You know? To hell with this. I&#x2019;m going to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>And while I&#x2019;m generally a HUGE advocate of taking to one&#x2019;s bed when things go wrong, in the case of giant messes, I&#x2019;d be remiss in my duties if I didn&#x2019;t tell you to allow yourself one minute in which you can huff and puff at yourself, the walls, the god who has clearly forsaken you, who- or what- ever, but when that minute is up take a deep breath and just deal with the mess right then and there.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll be happy you did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hard Clean</p><p>The hard clean is the thing you&#x2019;ll want to do anywhere between once a week and once a month, depending on how you use your kitchen. And also, let&#x2019;s be honest, on your willingness to clean things. I&#x2019;m giving timelines here because people like them, but I also want to make sure you know that really, this is a personal choice you can and should make for yourself. I&#x2019;m not here to assign chores to you, just to suggest to you how and when to do things if you so desire such information.</p><p>One thing that the hard clean is not is a pantry-clearing operation. We&#x2019;ll get to that later on down the line. The hard clean is meant to address the kitchen grime that the daily clean doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;think greasy buildup on walls, splattered appliances, crumbs lurking in corners.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Step 1: Set aside 1&#x2013;3 hours of your day!</b></p><p>Did you just do a double take? Yeah, I know. Sorry about that! But these things take time! However, the more often you clean, the less time it will take, which probably doesn&#x2019;t make you feel any better at all. What can I say, I tried.</p><p>The amount of time you&#x2019;ll need to make for this process is something you&#x2019;ll need to determine on your own. It will largely depend on the size of and relative filth situation in your kitchen. You&#x2019;ll also want to factor in the availability of helping hands. It bears mentioning that sometimes helping hands get in the way, so choose your helping hands wisely.</p><p><b>Step 2: Put on music!</b></p><p>The biggest mistake people make when setting out to tackle their chores is forgetting to put on music. It&#x2019;s basically the same theory behind listening to music at the gym: it gets you moving, perks you up, provides a rhythm to work along to. Cleaning is physical work! You will sweat! So, you know, treat big cleaning jobs just like you would a trip to the gym. Unless you&#x2019;re a person who skips the trip to the gym, in which case please don&#x2019;t treat cleaning like a trip to the gym!</p><p><b>Step 3: Gather your arsenal!</b></p><p>The cleaning products you choose depend on a few factors: what you&#x2019;ve got on hand, personal preference, the specific needs of your kitchen&#x2014;for example, granite countertops are best cleaned using products that are different from what you&#x2019;d use on butcher block&#x2014;and what, if any, particular messes require your attention.</p><p>With that said, try to keep it simple with your products. Two, maybe three, cleansers should do it for you. Among those three you&#x2019;ll want an abrasive, a degreaser, and an all-purpose spray&#x2014;preferably one that will shine up any metal; here, I&#x2019;d highly recommend making your own solution of white vinegar and water. If you&#x2019;re more into brand-name items, Windex is great too. Specifically Windex. With apologies to the other brands of glass cleaner on the market, for my money Windex is so clearly (GET IT?? Sorry.) superior it&#x2019;s not even worth fussing about with another product. Unless it&#x2019;s white vinegar and water. Then you have my blessing to commit Windex adultery.</p><p>In terms of an abrasive, I use Soft Scrub, though not exclusively. Sometimes I go for Comet or Bon Ami; just understand that a powder abrasive cleaner is going to be more abrasive, and therefore more likely to scratch delicate surfaces, than is a cream abrasive cleaner. I have a deep and abiding hatred of Bar Keepers Friend, though many, many people love it so much they want to marry it, so I feel like I should mention it here. They make both a powder and a cream product. But seriously, I hate that stuff, and I know hate is a strong word BUT STILL. It&#x2019;s utterly irrational. (It&#x2019;s actually not that irrational; I&#x2019;ve never had any success in using it to clean things it&#x2019;s often recommended for&#x2014;stainless steel and enameled cast-iron cookware, both of which I collect and care for in the way normal people care for their children&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m an expert cleaner, so it sends me into a mad frenzy of not understanding why and how people are loving this stuff so much.)</p><p>My degreaser of choice is ammonia, mixed with water, which I use on the regular to wipe down the cabinetry, walls, the ventilation hood, my floors, young children with sticky fingers, etc. But that&#x2019;s just me! If you prefer a less toxic degreaser, try mixing Dawn dish soap with warm water and using that as your cleaning solution for greasy messes. But also, you&#x2019;re all grown adults with values and opinions and mothers who may have imparted upon you a devotion to certain products, and so by all means, you do you.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;ve got all your products in hand, you&#x2019;ll need to assemble your accoutrements: A sponge, perhaps more than one. A few clean rags, swell things to have on hand. A roll of paper towels, yes, sure. BUT, BUT, BUT! Your hard clean should NOT be done with paper towels. First of all, it&#x2019;s foolishly wasteful, which is bad for our precious Mother Earth. But more important, paper towels will not cut it for the kind of cleaning we&#x2019;re talking about here. You&#x2019;ll want to have them nearby to do a final wipe-up, but you&#x2019;ll not want to rely on them to do the majority of your work.</p><p>If you choose to use something like bleach or ammonia that needs to be diluted into a solution, you&#x2019;ll also need a small bucket. You know what works really well for this and is kind of charming? Those plastic beach pails we all had as kids&#x2014;why not add some fun and whimsy to your cleaning routine? The other nice thing about them is that they have a handle, so you can carry your washing solution around the kitchen easily as you move from space to space.</p><p>Last but absolutely not least, you&#x2019;ll need a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands, Miss Scarlett!</p><p><b>Step 4: Clear all the things out!</b></p><p>All of them. Every last thing on your countertops must be moved to a secure location. Clearing everything out includes washing, drying, and putting away any dirty dishes in the sink. Now, listen, I know you, and I know you&#x2019;re going to try to cheat and (1) I&#x2019;ll know and (2) you&#x2019;ll only end up making more work for yourself down the road if you skimp on this step. I really promise that something that will take so much less time than you think will save you so much energy and annoyance and extra work in the next stages, so just do it.</p><p>But actually here, you have a decision: does your situation call for just a surface clean, or do you require a full-on pantry purge? Probably for most of you the surface clean will suffice. We&#x2019;ll get to the pantry purge when we tackle the full monty hard clean.</p><p><b>Step 5: Take a break!</b></p><p>I&#x2019;ll let you in on a secret: the hardest part is over. More or less, from here you&#x2019;re going to coast, and that&#x2019;s because you took the time to prepare. Bet you didn&#x2019;t see this coming, eh? So as a reward for your hard work, would you care for a cold beer or soda? I bet you would. Remember to buy some before you start this project. You&#x2019;ll get to make the best shopping list! It&#x2019;ll be like:</p><p>� Soft Scrub</p><p>� Sponges</p><p>� Beer</p><p>� Paper towels</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Step 6: CLEAN!</b></p><p>A HUGE rule of cleaning is to always work top to bottom. If you do your floors first and then wipe off a counter full of crumbs, guess where those crumbs are going? Yeah, right on your clean floor that&#x2019;s no longer clean and will need to be redone. So! Start from the top and work downward. Wipe the cabinetry, then the walls and backsplashes, then the countertops, then the appliances (refrigerator, stove, microwave, etc.), ending with the floors. Because cabinet and countertop materials vary so greatly from kitchen to kitchen, a bit later in the chapter we&#x2019;ll go over the particulars of which products should be used on which cabinet and counter types. Stay tuned for a handy chart!</p><p>Leave the sink be until the very, very end of the process; the sink will serve as your home base for dumping out dirty wash water, rinsing and wringing out sponges and rags, and probably some other gross things that we don&#x2019;t really need to talk about. (Dead bugs. I&#x2019;m talking about dead bugs, you guys.)</p><p>If you&#x2019;re feeling really brave, you might even take a look- see at the top of your cabinets.

But before you do so, please consider grabbing your trash can to execute a merciless decluttering. Most normal people have a ton of junk that they don&#x2019;t need taking up space in their kitchens&#x2014;and collecting filth! Old twist ties, unopened mail, mementos from three relation- ships ago that you&#x2019;re holding on to because you have an utter inability to admit when something is truly over, even though you&#x2019;re the one who ended it and frankly you&#x2019;ve never regretted a thing except that that ceramic lighthouse that you bought together on a trip to Maine is really just so special to you.</p><p>Put that ceramic lighthouse in the trash.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;ve thrown away anything you don&#x2019;t need, take a gander at what&#x2019;s going back into your squeaky-clean kitchen.

Editor and contributor James Keating divides the book into three sections: historical foundations, pastoral foundations, and sociological foundations for the diaconate, i.e., the core elements of the diaconal identity. Some of the subjects covered are the history of the diaconate, the morality of the deacon, the deacon and work, and the deacon&#39;s wife. The most significant deacon theologians contribute to this text as well as priest experts on the diaconate. It is a complete systematic academic text for the first years of formation of deacons according to the New Roman National Directory (2005). As such, it is indispensable. This is the first text ever that specifies the theological formation of the deacon student over a range of themes and specialties. There is nothing like it in print.</p><p>Deacon James Keating, PhD, editor of the Josephinum Journal of Theology, is associate professor of moral theology in the school of theology at the Pontifical College Josephinum, Columbus, OH.I welcome this publication as it offers a comprehensive set of articles that will facilitate teaching and discussion. -- <i>Most Rev.

But in this jewel of a book, Hal Urban -- parent, award-winning teacher, and author of the classic <i>Life's Greatest Lessons</i> -- shows us simple and immediate ways that we can use language to change lives -- both our own and those around us.</p><p><b>Hal Urban</b> was a high school teacher for many years and also taught at the University of San Francisco. He is a well-known leader in the Character Education movement and is in constant demand as a speaker at national conferences and school and community events. He raised three sons as a single father and now lives in Redwood City, California, with his wife, Cathy.<b>Introduction</b><br><br><b>Two Simple Reasons for Writing This Book</b><br><br><b>1. To Increase Awareness of the Impact Our Words Can Have</b><br><br><i>We live in an ocean of words, but like a fish in water we are often not aware of it.</i><br><br> -- Stuart Chase<br><br>The above statement was written in 1953 by a scholar who conducted extensive research on the power of words. Much has changed since then. There are about a billion more people, the literacy rate has risen dramatically, countless new methods of communication are available to us, and we've added thousands of new words to our vocabulary. So the ocean of words we live in today dwarfs the one we lived in during the 1950s. But some things never change. We seem just as unaware of their impact today as we were fifty years ago. Maybe more unaware.<br><br>I think this is so because we so often take things for granted. Words are tools that we've always had access to and have used every day since we started talking. Because they've always been there and because we use them so frequently, we get into verbal ruts. We often talk without thinking first and without being aware of the impact of our words. Yet they can have a powerful impact -- both on others and on ourselves.<br><br>Kahlil Gibran, the much-loved poet from Lebanon, wrote more than thirty years ago that "...in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered." Again, I don't think much has changed. "Put your mind in gear before putting your mouth in motion" is one of those timeless axioms that we too often forget. I hope to offer several practical reasons here for honoring it and for teaching and helping others to do the same. We need it more than ever.<br><br><b>2. To Encourage the Use of Words That Celebrate and Affirm Life</b><br><br><i>I can live for two months on one good compliment.</i><br><br> -- Mark Twain<br><br>It's been said that language is an index of civilization. What we hear all around us every day literally speaks volumes about our culture, our ethos, and our consideration for one another. I'm not alone in my belief that much of the language we've been hearing for the past thirty years has tarnished that civilization.<br><br>In the late 1960s, people were urged to "let it all hang out," and they've been doing just that, particularly with words, ever since. Much of the language we hear today has a harshness to it. To be more specific, it's often crude, angry, and mean-spirited. We hear it just about everywhere we go and it comes from people of most age groups.<br><br>Keep in mind that I said our civilization has been tarnished, not destroyed. What it needs is some tender loving care and a little polish. And I'm just optimistic enough to believe that we can apply that polish with a better choice of words.<br><br>Shortly after the first George Bush was sworn in as president in 1989, he was asked what his vision was for the country. He said he wanted America to become a "kinder, gentler" nation. Many people, regardless of political persuasion, were in agreement. But what happened? His comment was belittled and made fun of in the media. Only proving, of course, that we really <i>did</i> need to become a "kinder, gentler" nation. I still think it's possible, and a good way to start would be to use kinder, gentler words.<br><br>That's the theme of Chapter 10 in <i>Life's Greatest Lessons.</i> It's called "Kind Words Cost Little but Accomplish Much." I knew shortly after the first edition was published in 1992 that I wanted to expand on that particular lesson. Since then I've been listening, reading, conducting little experiments, and collecting anecdotes in order to support my theory that the words we use have a great impact on our lives...and on our society. So, in many ways, this book is an enlargement of that chapter, along with the ones on humor, respect, and thankfulness -- three more ways we can use words to enhance lives.<br><br>Another experience has further convinced me to build on that theme. Since 1995 I've been speaking at schools, conferences, businesses, and places of worship about the relationship between good character and the quality of life. A major part of each of those presentations is about the power of kind words. In fact, I'm often asked to give keynote addresses about that specific topic. Each time I do, the response is overwhelmingly positive. It's a hopeful sign.<br><br>In the preface to my first book I wrote the following: "I hope you will become part of the growing movement to return us to a society known for its civility, virtues, and old-fashioned goodness." The best tool we have for doing that is our language. It contains thousands of wonderful, positive, and life-affirming words. They're readily available, they're free, and we can use them any time we want. I encourage you, as I remind myself, to do it often. It's fun, it's positive, and it's rewarding. Our kind words <i>can</i> make a difference.<br><br><i>Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have.</i><br><br> -- Margaret Mead<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Hal Urban</p><h2>Waiting for Anya</h2><p><b>The gripping story of a boy who risks his life to take Jewish refugees to safety during World War II.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> A reclusive widow&#x2019;s farm has become a haven for a growing band of Jewish children hiding from the Nazis. Jo knows he must keep the secret, and help out any way he can. But when German soldiers move into town, the danger suddenly becomes much more real. As Jo knows all too well, the penalty for helping these children escape is death.<br><br>"In its understated style and gentle telling of a harsh lesson, the story is reminiscent of Lois Lowry's <i>Number the Stars</i>."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i><br><br> &#x201c;Action-packed . . . Morpurgo&#x2019;s characters rise above the two-dimensional, giving young people much to ponder in the areas of good versus evil and hero versus villain.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Horn Book</i><br> &nbsp;<br> An ALA Best Book for Young Adults</p><p><p>Michael Morpurgo is one of Britain s best-loved children s book writers. He has written more than one hundred books and has won the Smarties Book Prize, the Whitbread Award, and the Blue Peter Book Award for Private Peaceful. Michael was writer-in-residence at the Savoy Hotel from January to April 2007, and previously he was Great Britain s Children s Laureate from 2003 to 2005, a role that took him across the country to inspire a love of reading in children.<br><br></p>Grade 5-9-- In a village in southern France, only a few miles from Spain, Jo discovers that the Widow Horcada is sheltering Benjamin, her Jewish son-in-law, who is helping to smuggle Jewish children over the border. He is also waiting for his own child, Anya, from whom he was separated. When a garrison of German soldiers is sent to occupy the village in order to stop the flow of refugees into Spain, Benjamin needs the cooperation of the entire village to save the children. What Jo and the others learn, though, is that the Germans are human and that there are more similarities than differences among them. Readers do not see battles, but will witness their effects when Jo's father returns a sick and bitter man; they do not see the horrors of the death camps--it is enough to know that those who are taken away will not be seen again. Everything is seen through the eyes of one young, compassionate boy. There are no villains and no larger-than-life heroes, just human beings following what conscience or duty tells them is right. In its understated style and gentle telling of a harsh lesson, the story is reminiscent of Lois Lowry's Number the Stars (Houghton, 1989). --Susan M.

The recently completed English translation has received wide acclaim. Now John Bolt, one of the world's leading experts on Bavinck and editor of Bavinck's four-volume set, has abridged the work in one volume, offering students, pastors, and lay readers an accessible summary of Bavinck's masterwork. This volume presents the core of Bavinck's thought and offers explanatory materials, making available to a wider audience some of the finest Dutch Reformed theology ever written.<br><br><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Reformed Dogmatics<br></i></b>"Bavinck's magisterial <i>Reformed Dogmatics </i>remains after a century the supreme achievement of its kind."--J. I. Packer, Regent College</p><p>"After bringing Bavinck's magisterial <i>Reformed Dogmatics</i> to an English speaking audience, John Bolt has crowned the effort with this abridgment that will surely make the work accessible to a wider audience. For his commanding breadth of learning in biblical, systematic, historical, and philosophical theology as well as the rich depth of his exegetical and doctrinal insights, Bavinck stands out as the most important Reformed theologian of the nineteenth century. With Bolt's footnotes, obscure figures and debates are explained and their contemporary significance noted. This volume is a gift and a treasure, offering us one of the richest veins in the history of dogmatics."--<b>Michael Horton</b>, J. Gresham Machen Professor, Westminster Seminary California<br><br><b>Praise for Bavinck's four-volume </b><b><i>Reformed Dogmatics<br></i></b><br>"Bavinck was a man of giant mind, vast learning, ageless wisdom, and great expository skill. Solid but lucid, demanding but satisfying, broad and deep and sharp and stabilizing, Bavinck's magisterial <i>Reformed Dogmatics</i> remains after a century the supreme achievement of its kind."--<b>J. I. Packer</b>, Regent College<br><br>"Finally Bavinck becomes available to the English-speaking world. The Dutch version has been a constant stimulus for students, pastors, and other interested Christians. It has shaped generations of theologians and helped them to preach, think, and act on a fresh, Reformed basis. The strength of Bavinck's dogmatics is that it's neither conservative nor progressive, but its biblical character makes it constantly up-to-date."--<b>Herman Selderhuis</b>, Theologische Universiteit Appeldoorn<br><br>"What a wonderful gift to the English-speaking theological world! The topics explored by Bavinck are still of the utmost importance, and he addresses them here in a theological voice that is amazingly fresh."--<b>Richard J. Mouw</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"Bavinck is one of the premier Reformed theologians, but till now much of his magnum opus has not been accessible to English-language readers. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have made the treasures of Bavinck's thought available to a new world of appreciative hearers."--<b>Donald K. McKim</b>, editor, <i>Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith</i><b>Herman Bavinck</b> (1854-1921) succeeded Abraham Kuyper as professor of systematic theology at the Free University of Amsterdam in 1902. <b>John Bolt</b> (PhD, University of St. Michael's College) is professor of systematic theology at Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he has taught for more than twenty years.</p><h2>Ohio Rocks: A Guide to Geologic Sites in the Buckeye State</h2><p>Ohio was born billions of years ago, during a time when ancient minicontinents crystallized and then merged into larger continents. Its youth was marked by the coming and going of oceans and the advent of life from ocean to land. The Buckeye State matured when ice sheets scoured its landscape. This storyline is writ large and small in Ohio&#x2019;s rocks, from its flat till plains to the rumpled and hollowed landscape of the Appalachian Plateau.<br>In <i>Ohio Rocks!</i>, skilled writer and geologist Albert Dickas takes you to some of the state&#x2019;s most interesting geologic chapters. At Blackhand Gorge the sandy deposits of an ancient sea were cut and sculpted by glacial meltwater. In Scioto County you can trace the margins of a ghost river that flowed before the ice ages. And you can visit the historic Buckeye Furnace, which produced enough pig iron to make Ohio an industrial giant in the nineteenth century.<br>Color photos, maps, and figures compliment the text and further elucidate the geology within the rocks. <i>Ohio Rocks! </i>is the third book in the state-by-state Geology Rocks! series, which introduces readers to some of the most compelling and accessible geologic sites in each state.</p><p>Born in Ohio, Albert Binkley Dickas earned bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees from Miami University (Oxford, OH). After serving in the US Navy, he earned a PhD at Michigan State University and then worked in the petroleum industry. He then joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Superior, where he taught for thirty-one years. Today he lives on the crest of Brush Mountain in southwest Virginia. He is the author of the wildly popular 101 American Geo-Sites You&#x2019;ve Gotta See, also published by Mountain Press.</p><h2>The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s</h2><p>The 1930s were perhaps the seminal decade in twentieth-century history, a dark time of global depression that displaced millions, paralyzed the liberal democracies, gave rise to totalitarian regimes, and, ultimately, led to the Second World War. In this sweeping history, Piers Brendon brings the tragic, dismal days of the 1930s to life. <br><br>From Stalinist pogroms to New Deal programs, Brendon re-creates the full scope of a slow international descent towards war. Offering perfect sketches of the players, riveting descriptions of major events and crises, and telling details from everyday life, he offers both a grand, rousing narrative and an intimate portrait of an era that make sense out of the fascinating, complicated, and profoundly influential years of the 1930s.</p><p>"Dark Valley" as a phrase was coined first by the Japanese to refer to the desperate years of chaotic depression that followed the 1929 slump. But, as Piers Brendon's epic history of the same name vividly demonstrates, it was apt to describe any of the world's leading nations of the time--the crippled, traumatized European powers, a moody, solitary U.S., Stalin's outcast Soviet Union, and volatile, upstart Japan--with varying degrees of severity and fascinatingly contrasting outcomes. With no dishonor to those who endured the unspeakable traumas of the First World War, reading Brendon's scholarly tome leaves little scope to argue with the assertion, made by Leon Blum, among others, that the economic crisis and its effects were as traumatic as the "war to end all wars." Worse was to come, for sure, but the events that led to the "chasm" of the Second World War still boggle the mind--from our safe distance it is difficult to comprehend that this actually came to pass, yet at the same time the whole era seems to be engulfed by a fatalistic air of inevitability. In many ways, the insane dance of rampant ideological forces and economic desperation unleashed across the sphere make for the more gripping history, and in Brendon's hands, the cast of thousands is skillfully evoked, while the facts are judiciously evaluated, in a rolling narrative through the tribulations of the era. This is first-class historical writing, but certainly not for the faint-hearted. <i>--Alisdair Bowles, Amazon.co.uk</i>"The story of the 1930s has been told many times, but Brendon succeeds magnificently in breathing fresh life into the narrative . . . His text is a delight to read, a literary triumph sparkling with moments of real humour and compassion, sombre where it needs to be. Brendon is a master of the swift pen portrait, the telling anecdote, the curious footnotes to history that tell us more than a page of dusty scholarship."<br> -- <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i><br><br>"Piers Brendon's long book has such brilliance and narrative power, and contains so much fascinating detail that reading it has all the excitement of novelty." <br>-- <i>Evening Standard</i><br><br>"Historians are seldom thought of as elegant stylists, let alone as comic writers of the first rank. Piers Brendon is both . . . [He has] an eye for the telling detail that puts most novelists to shame."<br>-- <i>Sunday Express</i><br><br>"Piers Brendon's book, let's say it at once, is a tour de force . . . The book could hardly be better."<br>-- <i>The Scotsman</i><br><br>"Lively, fascinating . . . In telling his tale of the Thirties, Brendon paints a vivid and vigorous canvas . . . His character sketches of the principal players are sharp, perceptive, and often very funny."<br>-- <i>The Observer</i><br><br>"Distinctive and enthralling . . . Brendon's sweep and range are breathtakingly global. His story takes in everything and everywhere that matters between the 20th century's two world wars, moving with knowledge, insight, and wit . . . His detail--brilliant, cinematic, utterly illuminating--is arranged with a canny storyteller's knack. No other historical account I know can rival this fluently possessive sequence."<br>-- <i>Financial Times</i><br><br>"A cleverly sustained, and often moving account . . . familiar in its substance but fresh in its imagery." <br>-- <i>The Sunday Times</i> [London]<br><br>"[An] excellent survey of the Thirties . . . Brendon tells the story of this enormous and weighty subject with great skill and good humour."<br>-- Antony Beevor, author of <b>Stalingrad</b><br><br>"Endlessly fascinating."<br>-- <i>Literary Review</i></p><h2>Feathered Omens: Messenger Birds from the Spirit World (Book &amp; ORACLE Card Set)</h2><p>Boxed set of book and 40 full-color omen cards.

The book describes how to use the cards for insight, divination and answers to everyday situations and questions.</p><p></p><h2>The Stages of Our Spiritual Journey</h2><p>At the same time that &#34;A Course in Miracles&#34; emphasizes the non-dualistic nature of reality, which is infinite and eternal, beyond our experiential categories of space and time, we are also told that our journey is a process occurring over time. Thus we do not go directly from illusion to truth, but need to take the &#34;little steps&#34; (W-pI.193.13:7) that will lead us to our goal. These steps constitute the stages on our spiritual path. Friedrich Nietzsche&#39;s &#34;On the Three Metamorphoses,&#34; from his masterpiece &#34;Thus Spoke Zarathustra,&#34; offers a most helpful way of conceptualizing the journey. Using Nietzsche&#39;s parable of the camel, the lion, and the child, this book unfolds the process of spiritual development woven into the teachings of the Course. As these teachings demonstrate, the process is essentially a journey that proceeds in and through the world and on to spiritual maturity, this final stage marked by the ease of being in the world but not of it, seeing everything now through the eyes of forgiveness.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He has written more than 25 books on the Course, including Love Does Not Condemn, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; The Message of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and many others. He has also produced over 150 audio and video titles discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder, with his wife Gloria, of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula, California.</p><h2>Hands Up!</h2><p><b>This triumphant picture book recasts a charged phrase as part of a black girl's everyday life--hands up for a hug, hands up in class, hands up for a high five--before culminating in a moment of resistance at a protest march.</b><br><br>A young black girl lifts her baby hands up to greet the sun, reaches her hands up for a book on a high shelf, and raises her hands up in praise at a church service. She stretches her hands up high like a plane's wings and whizzes down a hill so fast on her bike with her hands way up. As she grows, she lives through everyday moments of joy, love, and sadness. And when she gets a little older, she joins together with her family and her community in a protest march, where they lift their hands up together in resistance and strength.</p><p>Breanna J.

And like nothing else, small groups provide the kind of life-giving community that builds and empowers the body of Christ and impacts the world. In this book, part of the Groups That Grow series of small group resources, authors Bill Donahue and Russ Robinson provide guidance for the strategic decisions that must be made to establish, develop and grow a thriving small group ministry in the local church. In Building a Life-Changing Small Group Ministry, they answer questions like: � Which approach or model for small group ministry is best for my church? � Who has responsibility for the ministry and how are they supported? � How do I organize the groups and coach the leaders? � Where do I find leaders and what kind of training do they need? � How do I guide people toward community life? What are the pathways and events that move people to become part of a small group? � What kinds of groups should we offer? � How do you multiply groups and launch new groups? � How do we define success in this ministry? As you work through the questions in each chapter you&#x2019;ll develop a coherent, strategic plan for building and leading the small group ministry at your church. And whether you are establishing a new ministry or transitioning from older models of small group ministry that are no longer effective today, you&#x2019;ll benefit from the time-tested wisdom of the authors.

Scripture scholars do not know, making him a fit subject for Michael O'Brien's vivid imagination. In this fictional narrative, Theophilos is the skeptical but beloved adoptive father of St. Luke. Challenged by the startling account of the "Christos" received in the chronicle from his beloved son Luke and concerned for the newly zealous young man's fate, Theophilos, a Greek physician and an agnostic, embarks on a search for Luke to bring him home. He is gravely concerned about the deadly illusions Luke has succumbed to regarding the incredible stories surrounding Jesus of Nazareth, a man of contradictions who has caused so much controversy throughout the Roman Empire.</p><p>Thus begins a long journey that will take Theophilos deep into the war between nations and empires, truth and myth, good and evil, and into unexpected dimensions of his very self. His quest takes the reader into four ancient civilizations #NAME? birth, where he meets those who knew this man that some believe is the Messiah.</p><p>Though Theophilos is a man of the past ages, he is as familiar to us as the men of our own times. Schooled in the empiricism of both medicine and philosophy, Theophilos is well suited to speak to our age in which seeing cannot be the basis for faith, but rather hearing the witness of those who have been touched by God and opening ourselves to the possibility of an encounter with the living Christ. This is a story about the mysterious interaction of faith and reason, the psychology of perception, and the power of love over death.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael D. O'Brien, </b>iconographer, painter, and writer, is the popular author of many best-selling novels including <i>Father Elijah</i>, <i>The Father's Tale</i>, <i>Eclipse of the Sun</i>, <i>Sophia House</i>, <i>Theophilos</i>, and <i>Island of the World</i>.

Then read this book! --<b>Peter Kreeft</b> Professor of Philosophy Boston College<br><br>O'Brien again takes up the theme of the truth of revelation before an unbelieving generation. This novel searches the soul of our time through the eyes of St. Luke and Theophilos and those they encountered, including the Lord Himself. O'Brien brings to life the wonder that filled the soul of Luke --<b>James V. Schall, SJ,</b> Professor of Political Philosophy, Georgetown University<br><br>All of Michael O'Brien's novels are in a sense 'historical,' even those often regarded as 'prophetic.' <i>Theophilos</i>, set long ago in the first century and meticulously researched, is finely textured, lush and convincing in its depiction of the rich embroglio of Mediterranean culture in the time of the apostles. The epistolary prose is hauntingly provocative, often lyrical, compelling in its characterization of the events reported in Luke and Acts as they might be considered from a learned gentile's point of view.

And typically it <em>is</em> seen as a descent--a falling away from a happier and untroubled state into the turbulent and sinful world we know. The title of the book refers to the idea put forward in antiquity that our souls begin with wings, and that only after shedding those wings do we fall to earth. The book not only traces the history of the idea of pre-existence, but also captures its meaning for those who have embraced it. Givens describes how pre-existence has been invoked to explain "the better angels of our nature," including the human yearning for transcendence and the sublime. Pre-existence has been said to account for why we know what we should not know, whether in the form of a Greek slave's grasp of mathematics, the moral sense common to humanity, or the human ability to recognize universals. The belief has explained human bonds that seem to have their own mysterious prehistory, salved the wounded sensibility of a host of thinkers who could not otherwise account for the unevenly distributed pain and suffering that are humanity's common lot, and has been posited by philosophers and theologians alike to salvage the principle of human freedom and accountability. <br><br><em>When Souls had Wings</em> underscores how durable (and controversial) this idea has been throughout the history of Western thought, the theological dangers it has represented, and how prominently it has featured in poetry, literature, and art.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terryl L. Givens</strong> is Professor of Literature and Religion and holds the Jabez A. Bostwick Chair of English at the University of Richmond. Some of his books include <em>Viper on the Hearth: Mormons, Myths, and the Construction of Heresy</em> (Oxford, 1997), <em>By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that</em> <em>Launched a New World Religion</em> (Oxford 2002), which the <em>New York Times</em> called "provocative reading," <em>People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture</em>, which was named Best Book of the Year by the Mormon History Association for 2007, and most recently, <em>The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction</em> (Oxford 2009).<br><br>"Givens could make a reader stop and think twice about a joke on a LaffyTaffy wrapper.

The answer can be summed up in a few words: President Donald J.&nbsp;Trump. Whether you love him or hate him, there&#x2019;s no question that&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;gained a huge amount of support for his willingness to criticize the media in harsh and unsparing terms. The media seems baffled by the fact that it&#x2019;s lost the trust of the American people. It has responded by being extraordinarily defensive and doubling down on histrionic attacks. However, the American system has always depended on a strong and trusted media to hold those in power accountable. Journalist Mollie Hemingway looks at the impressive list of media failure that led us to this unique moment and asks, Is it possible for the media to recover its credibility before it&#x2019;s too late?</p><p>Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at <em>The Federalist</em>. A longtime journalist, her work has appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal, USA Today,</em> the <em>Los Angeles Times,</em> the <em>Guardian,</em> the <em>Washington Post,</em> CNN, <em>National Review, Federal Times,</em> and many other publications. She is a frequent guest on FOX News, CNN, and National Public Radio. Mollie was a 2004 recipient of a Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship and a 2014 recipient of a Claremont Institute Lincoln Fellowship.Looked at from the perspective of conservative voters who feel that they have been repeatedly lied to and abused by media elites for decades, it&#x2019;s not hard to understand how we ended up with President Trump. The media, however, is so unrepentant and lacking in self-awareness that it is having real trouble admitting it&#x2019;s done anything wrong, and instead is indulging its worst impulses of hyperbole and hysteria. The fact remains that the current political situation is the logical result of the hostile and distrustful environment it cultivated, rather than some black-swan event unleashed by the sudden onset of irrationality of voters in flyover states. It was the media&#x2019;s decades-long approach of putting its thumb on the scale by covering conservatives and conservative causes poorly that created a lose-lose situation for conservatives. There was no way for them to operate successfully in a system where the media allowed them to be respected as the principled opposition only as long as they were shackled and limited by biased news coverage. And conservative voters were beyond sick of it. The media would say things that weren&#x2019;t true, and cover issues dishonestly, and then accuse others of being liars or gaffe-makers for disagreeing. No candidate&#x2015;not even squeaky-clean moderates like Mitt Romney&#x2015;would keep the media from painting Republicans and their beliefs as dangerous. It was enough to make half the country give up on the enterprise of working with the media altogether. Most Americans had no way to combat media crimes and their power to shape the culture and electoral outcomes, particularly if they were focused on their work and home life. And even most politicians weren&#x2019;t quite capable of combating this media power. Along came Trump, the brilliant master of exploiting public opinion. A New York real estate developer and reality TV celebrity, he had spent decades studying the media and how to make it work to his advantage. Understanding that conservatives had lost trust in the credibility of the media to cover politics accurately, the media became one of his primary targets, and he played it like a fiddle. Trump voters loved that he was beating up the bully they had been impotent to vanquish. They loved that he destroyed the media&#x2019;s power to declare things gaffes, much less campaign-destroying gaffes. Figures such as Chuck Todd can lament Trump&#x2019;s ability to put the media in its place as being &#x201c;unAmerican&#x201d; all he wants. The fact is that Trump wouldn&#x2019;t have this power had the media not set things up through decades of shoddy coverage targeting its political opponents. The media did this to itself. Trump&#x2019;s unique power to bring attention to the problems of the media also meant that his 2016 campaign proved a case study in identifying and examining pernicious media trends. Among the trends he identified that are worth exploring are the media&#x2019;s overwhelming desire to push narratives in spite of its inability to see the future; its undeniable coordination with the Democratic party; its attempts to present opinions as facts, and vice versa; and the blatant double standards in its coverage motivated by partisanship.</p><h2>Composing the Cheese Plate: Recipes, Pairings, and Platings for the Inventive Cheese Course</h2><p><strong>A complete introduction to everything you need to know about designing and plating beautiful cheese boards.</strong><br>Cheese need not stand alone! <em>Composing the Cheese Plate</em> isn't just another cheese book -- it's a gateway into the wonderful world of pairing and plating your favorite cheeses with dozens of sweet and savory condiments.

Things were going from bad to worse for Nick and his family. Tempted to run away after yet another argument with his mom, Nick receives a handwritten, leather-bound copy of an old book a family legend passed down to him from his great grandfather. </p><p>The book, called Dragon Seed, leads Nick deep into his family's history and introduces him to another angry young man who lived in the shadows (the shadows of the tombs). Like Nick, you ll be shocked to discover where he fits in this story of epic proportions! </p><p>This page-turning, young adult fiction story invites older children and teens into the real-life struggles of Nick. But it also ushers them into an imaginative exploration of the life of the young man Jesus saved as he wandered through the tombs. Best-selling author Marty Machowski uses both stories to introduce the reality of spiritual warfare and how its shadows affect and change us. Machowski, a trusted teacher for children of all ages, presents a thoroughly biblical view of spiritual warfare that emphasizes the importance of humility and dangers of pride. </p><p>Teens will be drawn to the story of Nick and his struggles and will learn, as they read, to also identify the shadows in their own life and turn from them. While the biblical teaching is evident throughout the narrative of Dragon Seed, Machowski also includes a twelve-lesson Bible study at the end of the book to help teens ground their understanding of spiritual warfare on Christian principles. Youth pastors, leaders, and Christian parents will also want to explore with teens the small group study at the end of the book with its unique take on spiritual warfare that emphasizes the biblical theme of humility. This is a perfect book to read with a group and discuss together the implications of Nick's struggles for their lives.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marty Machowski</strong> is a Family Life Pastor at Covenant Fellowship Church in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, where he has served on the pastoral staff for more than twenty years.

He and his wife Nancy have three children and oodles of grandchildren."Most Christians view the book of Ecclesiastes as an enigma, a puzzle from which we might draw a few aphorisms but little else. Douglas Wilson's fresh, lucid treatment of this wonderful book enables us to see that its message is not a confused riddle but an incisive indictment of 'the wisdom of this world.' We learn that what we call 'modernity' is simply a term for men sinning in the old ways with new toys and tools. There is truly nothing new 'under the sun'; man's problems today are exactly what they have been since the Fall. And the answer to man's problem is just as old, yet forever new-'the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.'" --<i>Steve Wilkins, Auburn Avenue Presbyterian Church</i></p><h2>Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook</h2><p>The Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook is your entry point to tabletop roleplaying.

But as we drag him across the lawn it ploughs into the soil. He&#x2019;s heavier than he looks too, unwieldy. Every few steps we stop and catch our breath, startling at each other&#x2019;s faces in the dawn light, daring each other to look down at the unbelievable fleshy fact of him, the childlike abandon of his outstretched arms.</p><p>Daisies are stuck to him now, their pink-white petals opening to the sun that is rising at a worrying speed behind the orchard. There's something very wrong about these daisies, stars in the dark sticky of his hair. Dot leans forward as if to pluck them out, sit down and thread them into a chain over the hammock of her gingham skirt. If she did it would not make anything stranger.</p><p>Another few stumbling steps, Dot&#x2019;s spectacles fall off. She starts to scrabble for them. We tell her to stop. There is no time. The birds are starting to sing, all at once, an explosion of noise, a wild loop of fear.</p><p>I try to talk myself down from blind panic: we are the same girls we were at the beginning of this long hot summer. Applecote Manor still stands behind us, gazing sleepily over the valley. And in the meadow beyond the garden gate, our beloved circle of prehistoric stones, unchanged, unchanging. We need to get him much closer to those stones, away from the house and fast &#x2013; the orangery&#x2019;s glass roof is glinting dangerously in the first rays of sun, even closer than we thought.</p><p>A whoosh of nausea folds me in half. I cough, hands on my knees. Flora slips her arm over my shoulders. Feeling her tremble, I look up, try to reassure her, but can&#x2019;t.</p><p>Eyes full of fear and light, Flora blinks repeatedly, as if adjusting to something in my face she hasn&#x2019;t seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pam, jaw clenched, starts tugging at his shirtsleeve. But the fabric is no match for the dead weight of his arm and it rips, the noise horrible, deafening. Dot smothers a sob with her hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right, Dot...&#x2019; I start to say then stop short, noticing a splatter of blood across her fingers.</p><p>I lower my gaze to check my own hands. Flora&#x2019;s. Pam&#x2019;s. My stomach rolls again. Our summer dresses are butcher&#x2019;s aprons. We all look like we killed him now, not just one of us. Sisters. Bonded by blood.</p><br><p>ONE</p><p>Over fifty years later</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crime. Crowds. The way a big city forces girls to grow up too fast, strips them of their innocence. It&#x2019;s time for the family to leave London, move somewhere gentler, more benign. They&#x2019;ve viewed a number of houses in the last three months &#x2013; the estate agents&#x2019; brief, rural, roomy, a fixer-upper &#x2013; but not one that Jessie felt could be called home. Until this moment: standing in Applecote Manor on a late January afternoon, feeling like she&#x2019;s being filled up with sunlight.</p><p>It is in a right state, of course. They couldn&#x2019;t hope of affording a house like this otherwise. Evergreens are packed hard against the orangery&#x2019;s windows, threatening to break them, scatter the wooden window seat with poisonous berries like beads. The stone flags on the floor undulate, rising in the centre of the room as if a creature might be pushing up from the earth. But Jessie is already imagining oranges dangling, blood-warm and heavy in the hand, the glass doors flung back to the euphoria of summer, the peal of girls&#x2019; wild laughter.</p><p>Her face soft, opening, Jessie tracks the paned glass as it climbs to its geometrical peak, a feat of Victorian engineering that promises tangy Mediterranean fruit in the English climate among the woolly pippins. Something about that optimism &#x2013; control through enclosure, a sort of forced nurturing &#x2013; whispers in her ear: isn&#x2019;t she trying to do something similar, only with a family?</p><p>Jessie glances at Bella, who is slumped on the window seat, pecking out a text on her mobile phone. A twist of too-long legs and inky hair, her sixteen-year-old stepdaughter is the striking spit of her dead mother, the first Mrs Tucker. Sensing Jessie&#x2019;s questioning gaze, she lifts her pale, aquiline face, narrows her eyes to glossy pupil-filled cracks, and answers it with a look of fierce refusal.</p><p>Jessie&#x2019;s glad Will didn&#x2019;t catch it, that look. Hands stuffed boyishly into his coat pockets, her husband is gazing back into the shadows of the adjoining kitchen with a sweetly furrowed air of recalibration as if struggling to square the rural dream &#x2013; an urban male fantasy of chopping logs, foraging, probably sex outside &#x2013; with the eerie sound of birds fluttering in cave-like chimneys, the sense of imprisoned pulpy damp, this terrifying, thrilling isolation.</p><p>Beneath the shearling of her favourite lambskin jacket, a 1970s-style one that suits these rough-hewn surroundings, Jessie&#x2019;s heart quickens. She tucks her unruly autumn-red hair repeatedly behind her ears, ordering her thoughts. For she knows there&#x2019;s a huge jump between viewing an old country house on a winter afternoon &#x2013; filmy silver light filtering through skeletal trees, moody and strange, like something dreamed &#x2013; and the stress of moving hundreds of miles away, shedding their city skins. It would be an act of reckless blind faith, like falling in love with Will had been. But the house simply feels right, as Will did from the start, and, on a level that she can&#x2019;t explain, like it was destined to be theirs.</p><p>And really, the scale of Applecote is perfect. They wouldn&#x2019;t be lost in it. Huge compared to their London semi, it&#x2019;s still a doll&#x2019;s house compared to the real old piles in the area &#x2013; the name &#x2018;manor&#x2019; is definitely pushing it. Only two rooms deep, the square footage is in the width, and it&#x2019;s rustic rather than grand with gnarled wood-wormed beams, walls that bulge as if breathing, no straight edges. A pelt of ivy covers the Cotswold stone exterior, the house not immediately visible from the road. Jessie likes this, the unshowiness, the way Applecote doesn&#x2019;t dominate the surrounding lush countryside but settles into it, like an elegant elderly lady dozing in long grass. Jessie can see Bella finally finding some peace here, and her daughter, Romy, freed from rubber-matted city playgrounds, climbing trees, those strawberry blonde curls catkin-fuzzed.</p><p>Romy already seems perfectly at home, prodding at the kiss of a snail&#x2019;s fleshy sucker on the other side of the glass with chubby toddler fingers. Jessie is sure her little girl will love the freedom of the countryside, just as she did as a kid, all those secret nooks of childhood, tiny worlds invisible to grown-up eyes. When the snail foams forward, Romy giggles and looks up: Jessie sees her own pixie-pretty features miniaturized, her family&#x2019;s Irish teal-blue, copper-lashed eyes, Will&#x2019;s full mouth. Jessie grins back, Romy&#x2019;s delight her own. Their relationship is still porous, umbilical, the opposite of the one with Bella, which seems to be fortressed by a wall just as thick as Applecote&#x2019;s. Occasionally, she can peer over it, if she pulls herself up, dangling precariously. Not often. Certainly not today.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been over three years since Jessie crossed the city with her five months pregnant belly, the world&#x2019;s happiest accident, bulking under her coat like a hidden present &#x2013; and moved into Will&#x2019;s house. Two years after Mandy died. Not wanting to intrude upon his life or his daughter&#x2019;s, Jessie had hung on to her independence and Dalston flat-share as long as possible, resisting the man she&#x2019;d fallen madly in love with &#x2013; &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t want to waste another minute of my life apart from you, I need you, we need you, Jessie&#x2019; &#x2013; until it became ridiculous and impractical. They didn&#x2019;t want to unsettle Bella further by moving then, not with a new baby on the way. And Jessie naively believed that a big heart, an eagerness to love Bella as her own, would eventually win over the fawn-like girl with the haunted eyes, who clung to her father&#x2019;s hand as if he were the last human left on earth. She had no idea that trying to love Bella, let alone parent her as she grew into an angry teen, would be like trying to hug an animal that wanted to sink its teeth into her neck. That she might never be forgiven for invading Bella&#x2019;s private world with her father and bringing forth the joy, noise and disruption that was Romy, a rival for her father&#x2019;s affections, and embarrassing proof of his new sex life. And who could blame poor Bella?</p><p>Time, everyone says. But time seems to be making things worse for Bella in London, not better, like something fragile left outside in the polluted city air, accruing damage. These last few months have been particularly bad, hormonally explosive with an unsettling crescendo that&#x2019;s forced their hand here. Both Jessie and Will are agreed that Bella, whether she wants it or not &#x2013; not, obviously &#x2013; needs a fresh start. She must be removed from the skunky parties and the toxic cliques, taken far away from what she did to that girl, everything that happened. There&#x2019;s no point just moving to another London borough. If they&#x2019;re going to do it, they need to be radical, reframe their lives. They will leave the city for somewhere much more innocent and benign. And what could be more innocent than Applecote Manor?&nbsp;</p><p>And yet.</p><p>The windowpane bisecting the family&#x2019;s reflection seems uncannily symbolic, reminding Jessie that there are other, murkier reasons Applecote draws them: Will trying to escape the mental imprint of a lorry turning left, the broken body of his beautiful wife churned along a concrete road; Jessie&#x2019;s insecurities, the ones that flare secretly, pettily in her brain. For how can she tell Will that she&#x2019;s never felt comfortable in his dead wife&#x2019;s smart house, a domestic life that was never hers? That she has to fight terrible childish urges to paint over the chic grey walls with a riot of colour? That this is his second marriage, yes, but it is her first, her only, and she wants it to have its own unique character. And, that, Mandy, magnificent Mandy Tucker, a subject so huge and heartbreaking that Jessie daren&#x2019;t mention her at all, is inescapable in that London house. Only last week Jessie pulled out one of Mandy&#x2019;s silk scarves from behind the radiator in the hallway. Sitting down on the stairs, the grey walls pressing in, the scarlet scarf limp in her hand, secreting another woman&#x2019;s expensive scent, she wondered what to do with it. In the end, at a loss, she dropped it back behind the radiator and felt terrible. But Jessie knew that bits of Mandy would always be in that house, her marriage, hiding in crannies, waiting, watching.</p><p>They wouldn&#x2019;t be at Applecote Manor. No ghosts here.</p><p>&#x2018;I can tell you&#x2019;ve already moved in,&#x2019; says Will, making her start, guiltily pushing thoughts of Mandy away.</p><p>She can see her own smile spread in his tawny brown eyes. &#x2018;And I can tell you&#x2019;re still on the motorway. Outside London.&#x2019;</p><p>A laugh rumbles up from his thick coat. &#x2018;I might turn off.&#x2019;</p><p>Something inside sinks. He&#x2019;s losing his nerve. &#x2018;Might?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We can&#x2019;t afford it, Jessie. Not if you figure in all the work that needs doing. Unless you want to live like a squatter.&#x2019;</p><p>Even this has a romantic appeal. Jessie imagines them all huddled around a roaring fire for warmth, drinking cocoa from tin mugs, telling each other stories.</p><p>&#x2018;The commute to the London office will be like some sort of daily triathlon.&#x2019; Will&#x2019;s eyes sparkle, warming to his theme. &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t know a soul here. In fact, there isn&#x2019;t a soul here. We may as well move to Mars.&#x2019;</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Jessie sees Bella nodding fervently in agreement.</p><p>Jessie thinks of the journey out of the city earlier in the day through sleepy suburbs, the anonymous banker satellite towns, chocolate-box villages, the cold skies clearing, bluing, until they passed the point at which a daily commute into London was, Will joked blackly, &#x2018;completely unfeasible without a mid-life crisis,&#x2019; on and on, a series of country roads, smeared with the bloating carcasses of fox and pheasant, then a narrow lane, squeezed between hedgerows, a deserted old house, waiting. In a way she doesn&#x2019;t quite understand, it felt like a route back inside herself. She can&#x2019;t turn back.</p><p>&#x2018;Total madness.&#x2019; Will&#x2019;s mouth starts to twitch with a smile. &#x2018;<i>But</i>...&#x2019; He is the only man she&#x2019;s ever met who can seduce only with his eyes. &#x2018;...it is wild and beautiful, just like you.&#x2019;</p><p>Bella groans, &#x2018;Oh God&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x2018;And you&#x2019;ve got a slightly mad, determined look going on that&#x2019;s making me think you might just move here anyway, whether I come or not.&#x2019; He grins at her from beneath his mop of floppy dark hair that he likes to wear a little too long, a little rock and roll, a small rebellion against being forty-five, nine years older than Jessie, and the demands of the growing logistics company he set up fifteen years ago with an old college friend, Jackson. A large, loud bachelor, Jackson was best man at Will&#x2019;s first wedding (huge, white) and absent from his second, (a family-only affair in a registry office, Jessie in a green dress, scarlet lipstick, a baby on her hip).</p><p>&#x2018;So, yes, there&#x2019;s a chance that you might be able to persuade me. A very small chance.&#x2019; He pulls her toward him, lightly pressing his hand against the curves of her bottom.</p><p>Jessie wishes they could make love here, right now, mark their territory. She nuzzles against the stubble of his chin.</p><p>Appalled by any display of physical affection &#x2013; and attuned to it &#x2013; Bella looks up abruptly, and guns her father&#x2019;s right hand. Jessie feels the flinch in the contracting muscles of Will&#x2019;s fingertips. She sidesteps away to make it easier for him. The embroidered hem of her skirt swishes back against her knee-length leather boots. &#x2018;What do you think, Bella?&#x2019; she asks, maybe a bit too brightly.</p><p>Bella burrows her eyes into the phone again. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d sooner hang myself from a door by a belt than move here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t hold back. Tell us how you really feel,&#x2019; says Will, gamely trying to humour her. Bella&#x2019;s face remains blank, violently silent.</p><p>Romy&#x2019;s large blue eyes look up from the roly-poly scuttling along the floor to her mother, sensing something wrong.</p><p>Jessie&#x2019;s fingers reach for the gold charm, a tiny gingerbread man, that hangs on the chain around her neck, a necklace Will gave her to mark Romy&#x2019;s birth, her most cherished possession. The skin-warmed metal calms Jessie, as it always does. She&#x2019;s needed to touch it a lot in the last few months as worries about Bella and the fractures in this rapidly patched-together family rumble beneath the surface of her day.</p><p>&#x2018;Bell, Bell.&#x2019; Romy stomps over to Bella, presents an offering of a roly-poly balled in her cupped hand, and grins, ever hopeful. Bella recoils and shoots one of those chilly looks at Romy that makes Jessie shudder. There&#x2019;s something in Bella&#x2019;s gaze that is just not sisterly sometimes, not even particularly human. &nbsp;But she&#x2019;d never say this to Will.</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we hit the road then, baby bear?&#x2019; Will swings Romy up in his arms, on to his shoulders, where she sits very upright, kicking her feet like a tiny mahout. He tries to talk to Jessie as Romy covers his eyes with her hands. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m starving, sweetheart.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;One last look?&#x2019; Something in Jessie...</p></p><h2>Guys and Dolls and Other Writings (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>From Dave the Dude to Al Capone: a defining collection from the world of Damon Runyon</b> <br><br> Damon Runyon grew up in the West, moved to New York City, and became one of the leading voices of American popular culture.

And what is more, she takes quite a number of peeks right back at him. And there you are. When a guy and a doll get to taking peeks back and forth at each other, why, there you are indeed.<br> &nbsp;<br> This Waldo Winchester is a nice-looking young guy who writes pieces about Broadway for the Morning Item. He writes about the goings-on in night clubs, such as fights, and one thing and another, and also about who is running around with who, including guys and dolls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes this is very embarrassing to people who may be married and are running around with people who are not married, but of course Waldo Winchester cannot be expected to ask one and all for their marriage certificates before he writes his pieces for the paper.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chances are if Waldo Winchester knows Miss Billy Perry is Dave the Dude&#x2019;s doll, he will never take more than his first peek at her, but nobody tips him off until his second or third peek, and by this time Miss Billy Perry is taking her peeks back at him and Waldo Winchester is hooked.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, he is plumb gone, and being a sucker, like I tell you, he does not care whose doll she is. Personally, I do not blame him much, for Miss Billy Perry is worth a few peeks, especially when she is out on the floor of Miss Missouri Martin&#x2019;s Sixteen Hundred Club doing her tap dance. Still, I do not think the best tap-dancer that ever lives can make me take two peeks at her if I know she is Dave the Dude&#x2019;s doll, for Dave somehow thinks more than somewhat of his dolls.<br> &nbsp;<br> He especially thinks plenty of Miss Billy Perry, and sends her fur coats, and diamond rings, and one thing and another, which she sends back to him at once, because it seems she does not take presents from guys. This is considered most surprising all along Broadway, but people figure the chances are she has some other angle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, this does not keep Dave the Dude from liking her just the same, and so she is considered his doll by one and all, and is respected accordingly until this Waldo Winchester comes along.<br> &nbsp;<br> It happens that he comes along while Dave the Dude is off in the Modoc on a little run down to the Bahamas to get some goods for his business, such as Scotch and champagne, and by the time Dave gets back Miss Billy Perry and Waldo Winchester are at the stage where they sit in corners between her numbers and hold hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course nobody tells Dave the Dude about this, because they do not wish to get him excited. Not even Miss Missouri Martin tells him, which is most unusual because Miss Missouri Martin, who is sometimes called &#x201c;Mizzoo&#x201d; for short, tells everything she knows as soon as she knows it, which is very often before it happens.<br> &nbsp;<br> You see, the idea is when Dave the Dude is excited he may blow somebody&#x2019;s brains out, and the chances are it will be nobody&#x2019;s brains but Waldo Winchester&#x2019;s, although some claim that Waldo Winchester has no brains or he will not be hanging around Dave the Dude&#x2019;s doll.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know Dave is very, very fond of Miss Billy Perry, because I hear him talk to her several times, and he is most polite to her and never gets out of line in her company by using cuss words, or anything like this. Furthermore, one night when One-eyed Solly Abrahams is a little stewed up he refers to Miss Billy Perry as a broad, meaning no harm whatever, for this is the way many of the boys speak of the dolls.<br> &nbsp;<br> But right away Dave the Dude reaches across the table and bops One-eyed Solly right in the mouth, so everybody knows from then on that Dave thinks well of Miss Billy Perry. Of course Dave is always thinking fairly well of some doll as far as this goes, but it is seldom he gets to bopping guys in the mouth over them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, one night what happens but Dave the Dude walks into the Sixteen Hundred Club, and there in the entrance, what does he see but this Waldo Winchester and Miss Billy Perry kissing each other back and forth friendly. Right away Dave reaches for the old equalizer to shoot Waldo Winchester, but it seems Dave does not happen to have the old equalizer with him, not expecting to have to shoot anybody this particular evening.<br> &nbsp;<br> So Dave the Dude walks over and, as Waldo Winchester hears him coming and lets go his strangle-hold on Miss Billy Perry, Dave nails him with a big right hand on the chin. I will say for Dave the Dude that he is a fair puncher with his right hand, though his left is not so good, and he knocks Waldo Winchester bow-legged. In fact, Waldo folds right up on the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, Miss Billy Perry lets out a screech you can hear clear to the Battery and runs over to where Waldo Winchester lights, and falls on top of him squalling very loud. All anybody can make out of what she says is that Dave the Dude is a big bum, although Dave is not so big, at that, and that she loves Waldo Winchester.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dave walks over and starts to give Waldo Winchester the leather, which is considered customary in such cases, but he seems to change his mind, and instead of booting Waldo around, Dave turns and walks out of the joint looking very black and mad, and the next anybody hears of him he is over in the Chicken Club doing plenty of drinking.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is regarded as a very bad sign indeed, because while everybody goes to the Chicken Club now and then to give Tony Bertazzola, the owner, a friendly play, very few people care to do any drinking there, because Tony&#x2019;s liquor is not meant for anybody to drink except the customers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, Miss Billy Perry gets Waldo Winchester on his pegs again, and wipes his chin off with her handkerchief, and by and by he is all okay except for a big lump on his chin. And all the time she is telling Waldo Winchester what a big bum Dave the Dude is, although afterwards Miss Missouri Martin gets hold of Miss Billy Perry and puts the blast on her plenty for chasing a two-handed spender such as Dave the Dude out of the joint.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are nothing but a little sap,&#x201d; Miss Missouri Martin tells Miss Billy Perry. &#x201c;You cannot get the right time off this newspaper guy, while everybody knows Dave the Dude is a very fast man with a dollar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I love Mr. Winchester,&#x201d; says Miss Billy Perry. &#x201c;He is so romantic. He is not a bootlegger and a gunman like Dave the Dude. He puts lovely pieces in the paper about me, and he is a gentleman at all times.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now of course Miss Missouri Martin is not in a position to argue about gentlemen, because she meets very few in the Sixteen Hundred Club and anyway, she does not wish to make Waldo Winchester mad as he is apt to turn around and put pieces in his paper that will be a knock to the joint, so she lets the matter drop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Miss Billy Perry and Waldo Winchester go on holding hands between her numbers, and maybe kissing each other now and then, as young people are liable to do, and Dave the Dude plays the chill for the Sixteen Hundred Club and everything seems to be all right. Naturally we are all very glad there is no more trouble over the proposition, because the best Dave can get is the worst of it in a jam with a newspaper guy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Personally, I figure Dave will soon find himself another doll and forget all about Miss Billy Perry, because now that I take another peek at her, I can see where she is just about the same as any other tap-dancer, except that she is red-headed. Tap-dancers are generally blackheads, but I do not know why.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moosh, the doorman at the Sixteen Hundred Club, tells me Miss Missouri Martin keeps plugging for Dave the Dude with Miss Billy Perry in a quiet way, because he says he hears Miss Missouri Martin make the following crack one night to her: &#x201c;Well, I do not see any Simple Simon on your lean and linger.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This is Miss Missouri Martin&#x2019;s way of saying she sees no diamond on Miss Billy Perry&#x2019;s finger, for Miss Missouri Martin is an old experienced doll, who figures if a guy loves a doll he will prove it with diamonds. Miss Missouri Martin has many diamonds herself, though how any guy can ever get himself heated up enough about Miss Missouri Martin to give her diamonds is more than I can see.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am not a guy who goes around much, so I do not see Dave the Dude for a couple of weeks, but late one Sunday afternoon little Johnny McGowan, who is one of Dave&#x2019;s men, comes and says to me like this: &#x201c;What do you think? Dave grabs the scribe a little while ago and is taking him out for an airing!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, Johnny is so excited it is some time before I can get him cooled out enough to explain. It seems that Dave the Dude gets his biggest car out of the garage and sends his driver, Wop Joe, over to the Item office where Waldo Winchester works, with a message that Miss Billy Perry wishes to see Waldo right away at Miss Missouri Martin&#x2019;s apartment on Fifty-ninth Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course this message is nothing but the phonus bolonus, but Waldo drops in for it and gets in the car. Then Wop Joe drives him up to Miss Missouri Martin&#x2019;s apartment, and who gets in the car there but Dave the Dude. And away they go.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now this is very bad news indeed, because when Dave the Dude takes a guy out for an airing the guy very often does not come back. What happens to him I never ask, because the best a guy can get by asking questions in this man&#x2019;s town is a bust in the nose.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I am much worried over this proposition, because I like Dave the Dude, and I know that taking a newspaper guy like Waldo Winchester out for an airing is apt to cause talk, especially if he does not come back. The other guys that Dave the Dude takes out for airings do not mean much in particular, but here is a guy who may produce trouble, even if he is a sucker, on account of being connected with a newspaper.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know enough about newspapers to know that by and by the editor or somebody will be around wishing to know where Waldo Winchester&#x2019;s pieces about Broadway are, and if there are no pieces from Waldo Winchester, the editor will wish to know why. Finally it will get around to where other people will wish to know, and after a while many people will be running around saying: &#x201c;Where is Waldo Winchester?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And if enough people in this town get to running around saying where is So-and-so, it becomes a great mystery and the newspapers hop on the cops and the cops hop on everybody, and by and by there is so much heat in town that it is no place for a guy to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> But what is to be done about this situation I do not know. Personally, it strikes me as very bad indeed, and while Johnny goes away to do a little telephoning, I am trying to think up someplace to go where people will see me, and remember afterwards that I am there in case it is necessary for them to remember.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally Johnny comes back, very excited, and says: &#x201c;Hey, the Dude is up at the Woodcock Inn on the Pelham Parkway, and he is sending out the word for one and all to come at once. Good Time Charley Bernstein just gets the wire and tells me. Something is doing. The rest of the mob are on their way, so let us be moving.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But here is an invitation which does not strike me as a good thing at all. The way I look at it, Dave the Dude is no company for a guy like me at this time. The chances are he either does something to Waldo Winchester already, or is getting ready to do something to him which I wish no part of.<br> &nbsp;<br> Personally, I have nothing against newspaper guys, not even the ones who write pieces about Broadway. If Dave the Dude wishes to do something to Waldo Winchester, all right, but what is the sense of bringing outsiders into it? But the next thing I know, I am in Johnny McGowan&#x2019;s roadster, and he is zipping along very fast indeed, paying practically no attention to traffic lights or anything else.<br> &nbsp;<br> As we go busting out the Concourse, I get to thinking the situation over, and I figure that Dave the Dude probably keeps thinking about Miss Billy Perry, and drinking liquor such as they sell in the Chicken Club, until finally he blows his topper. The way I look at it, only a guy who is off his nut will think of taking a newspaper guy out for an airing over a doll, when dolls are a dime a dozen in this man&#x2019;s town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, I remember reading in the papers about a lot of different guys who are considered very sensible until they get tangled up with a doll, and maybe loving her, and the first thing anybody knows they hop out of windows, or shoot themselves, or somebody else, and I can see where even a guy like Dave the Dude may go daffy over a doll.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can see that little Johnny McGowan is worried, too, but he does not say much, and we pull up in front of the Woodcock Inn in no time whatever, to find a lot of other cars there ahead of us, some of which I recognize as belonging to different parties.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Woodcock Inn is what is called a roadhouse, and is run by Big Nig Skolsky, a very nice man indeed, and a friend of everybody&#x2019;s. It stands back a piece off the Pelham Parkway and is a very pleasant place to go to, what with Nig having a good band and a floor show with a lot of fair-looking dolls, and everything else a man can wish for a good time. It gets a nice play from nice people, although Nig&#x2019;s liquor is nothing extra.</p></p><h2>Ukraine: A History, Fourth Edition</h2><p><p>In 1988, the first edition of Orest Subtelny's <i>Ukraine</i> was published to international acclaim, as the definitive history of what was at that time a republic in the USSR. In the years since, the world has seen the dismantling of the Soviet bloc and the restoration of Ukraine's independence - an event celebrated by Ukrainians around the world but which also heralded a time of tumultuous change for those in the homeland.</p><br><br><p>While previous updates brought readers up to the year 2000, this new fourth edition includes an overview of Ukraine's most recent history, focusing on the dramatic political, socio-economic, and cultural changes that occurred during the Kuchma and Yushchenko presidencies. It analyzes political developments - particularly the so-called Orange Revolution - and the institutional growth of the new state. Subtelny examines Ukraine's entry into the era of globalization, looking at social and economic transformations, regional, ideological, and linguistic tensions, and describes the myriad challenges currently facing Ukrainian state and society.</p></p><p><b>Orest Subtelny</b> is a professor in the Departments of History and Political Science at York University.<p></p>'An excellent history of Ukrainians.'

Great! But before you jump in, permit me to give you a quick preview of how this book works. The bulk of the pages feature not recipes, but equations: Each one shows a picture of a cake and directs you to the components&#x2014;a batter + a syrup + a frosting + (sometimes) a topping&#x2014;used to make it spectacular. This book has more photos than recipes to illustrate the versatility of the simple, basic anatomy of the cakes. The recipes are almost instinctual and will soon become second nature: Bake and assemble one cake, and you&#x2019;ll know how it works for all one hundred. The process for each cake is essentially the same&#x2014;only the flavors change. Here is the basic breakdown:<br><b>1. Flip to the photo of a cake you want to make.</b> Drool. Note the page references for the cake batter, flavoring syrup, and frosting recipes needed to make it.<br><b>2. Turn to the back of the book to find the recipes. </b>Mark each with one of the colored ribbons.<br><b>3. Make a batch of Cake Magic! Cake Mix</b> (page 142), which serves as the foundation for every cake in the book.<br><b>4. Follow the recipes you&#x2019;ve marked</b>&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be making cake layers, a flavored syrup, frosting, and so on&#x2014;and assemble the cake as directed on page 120.<br><b>5. Eat!</b><br><br><i>A NOTE FOR GLUTEN-FREE AND VEGAN BAKERS AND EATERS:</i><br> I want everyone to feel comfortable playing around in the kitchen, and even breaking a few baking rules. When I say &#x201c;everyone,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m including people with food restrictions for whom cake baking (and eating) can be challenging. With them in mind, I&#x2019;ve created a Gluten-Free Cake Magic! Cake Mix (page 143) that works as a substitute for the one using all-purpose flour. For vegan bakers, I&#x2019;ve offered variations on the batters that make any cake in this book vegan-friendly. (And any recipes that are already gluten-free or vegan are marked accordingly with these respective icons: GF � V.) These variations are supremely tasty and were developed to mimic the texture and flavors of the cakes made with all the standard components. They can be syruped, frosted, topped, and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;enjoyed just like any other cake in this book.<br><br><i>These recipes work as cupcakes, Bundts, and sheet cakes, too&#x2014;for instructions on adapting them, see pages 120&#x2013;121.</i></p><h2>High Definition Leader</h2><p><i>The High-Definition Leader</i> is an invitation of grace for churches and their leaders to grasp the ancient call of the early New Testament Church that crossed ethnic and socioeconomic barriers to create heavenly colonies of love, reconciliation, and unity on earth. In it, you will learn the theology and practices that will help you build a mission-shaped, multi-ethnic church.</p><p><b>Derwin L.

I had known Naomi Wallace&#39;s work well, having directed an earlier play, and I knew she had tremendous talent and promise to do great things. Nothing had prepared me - not my admiration for her plays and for her beautiful, harsh, moving, brilliantly political poetry - for the experience of watching this play, which is in my opinion one of the finest works of dramatic literature written here or in England in the last two decades. Utterly without sentiment but possessed of a very great human heart, ONE FLEA SPARE touches upon many things, class and gender and the pressures of a plague upon internal and external human constructs; and, as I read it, most devastatingly it addresses a tragedy of almost inexpressible dimensions: the consequences of the horrors of biology and Capital on the young. As the play draws to its shattering close I was filled with thoughts of the children of Sarajevo and Rwanda and the slums of America. &#39;Almost&#39; inexpressible except in the hands of a true poet, and Naomi Wallace so magnificently proves herself to be. Her ability to articulate the inarticulable, grief and loss and suffering beyond endurance, is a source of hope; as is the resilience and passion of the marvelous characters she&#39;s assembled. Everyone who loves the theater should read this play. It has made me INTENSELY envious and very full of joy.&#34; -Tony Kushner &#34;Naomi Wallace sharply tightens her focus in this latest, thrillingly original work, set for the most part in a virtually bare London room during the Great Plague.&#34; -Jeremy Kingston, The Times (London) &#34;Poetic ... Naomi Wallace&#39;s ONE FLEA SPARE is another example of fine, ambitious writing ... The London plague is evoked in statistics and the overwhelming reality of quirky, Marivaux-like social role reversals in a single room.&#34; -Michael Coveney, The Observer (London) &#34;Naomi Wallace makes an opaque but artful and haunting New York debut with her ONE FLEA SPARE ... ONE FLEA SPARE is built to provoke, not to distract, and it doesn&#39;t surrender its meanings easily. But the play&#39;s powerful sexual subtext and its beautiful poetic surface reveal an original theatrical imagination. Whether Wallace will find a big audience remains to be seen. She has a big talent, though. Wherever her plays are mounted, they&#39;re worth finding.&#34; -John Lahr, The New Yorker</p><p>Naomi Wallace is from Kentucky. She was a 1999 recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, the grant popularly known as the genius award. A published poet in both England and The United States, she has also received grants from The Kentucky Foundation for Women and The Kentucky Arts Council and a 1997 NEA grant for poetry.</p><h2>Plan and Play, Play and Plan: Defining Your Art Practice</h2><p><p>"Visual artist" is a term with manifold variations and meanings. But how, as an artist (or designer, photographer or other "independent creator"), do you become who you are and who you would like to be? How can you guide your artistic practice? <i>Plan and Play, Play and Plan</i> invites the artist to explore their own questions about their work, using analytical models to help them determine where they stand and what they stand for.</p><p>The author Janwillem Schrofer was director of Amsterdam's Rijksakademie from 1982 to 2010, and thus knows from practical experience the complexity of the artist's dilemmas and how important self-reflection is for artistic practice.

The story begins and ends with the mother speaking in soothing rhyming verse; her alphabetized descriptions of "the awake animals getting sleepy" are non-rhyming but mostly alliterative, e.g., "Cat's curled up on a crimson couch cushion." Full-page watercolor and ink illustrations in soft, muted colors depict mildly stylized, drowsy animals (generally one, but sometimes two or three per letter). The large cursive capitals fit well into the overall design of the pages, noticeable but unobtrusive. With dozens, if not hundreds, of other alphabet books out there (including previous alphabet books by Dragonwagon and McPhail), it might be difficult to find room for one more, especially in smaller collections; however, if you are looking for new additions, this one is quietly pleasant.-Yelena Alekseyeva-Popova, formerly at Chappaqua Library, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

He contributes regularly to <i>Empire, Total Film, Cinema Retro, </i>and <i>The Independent. </i>A former stand up comedian, he lives in the United Kingdom with his wife and daughter.</p>HELLRAISERS (Chapter One)An Aperitif <p>Throughout the history of movies there have always been hellraisers; actors and booze go together like Rogers and Hammerstein or eggs and bacon. Film producer Euan Lloyd, who worked over the years with Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum and Dean Martin, says that drinking simply went with the job. &#x2018;Whether it was lack of confidence or just habit, it was hard to tell, but a destroyer could comfortably swim in the ocean of liquid consumed by actors.&#x2019;</p><p>Lloyd&#x2019;s association with Burton and Harris was the boy&#x2019;s own adventure, perhaps the archetypal hellraiser movie, The Wild Geese, which also starred veteran boozer Stewart Granger and Roger Moore, himself not averse to a bit of elbow-bending, but able to hold it more than most. By 1978, after decades on the piss, Burton and Harris were mere shadows of their former selves. One day during a break in filming they sat together under the African sun reminiscing and trying to make sense of their lives. &#x2018;We were like two old men,&#x2019; Harris said. &#x2018;Once the greatest hellraisers in the world, we were now too tired to stand up and pee. After two hours of philosophical discussion, we came to the conclusion that the tragedy of our lives was the amount of it we don&#x2019;t remember, because we were too drunk to remember.&#x2019;</p><p>So why did they do it, Burton, Harris, O&#x2019;Toole and Reed, why did they drink themselves to death, or &#x2013; in the case of O&#x2019;Toole &#x2013; come within a hairsbreadth of it? Burton said it was &#x2018;to burn up the flatness, the stale, empty, dull deadness that one feels when one goes offstage.&#x2019; More likely it was to get over the realization that he was appearing in a piece of shit. Nor was he averse to getting pissed on the job. Maybe it went hand in hand with his reputation as a legendary womanizer: not long after starting his infamous affair with Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Cleopatra, Richard Burton answered the phone at her home. It was Taylor&#x2019;s husband, Eddie Fisher, demanding to know what he was doing there. &#x2018;What do you think I&#x2019;m doing?&#x2019; Burton replied. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m fucking your wife.&#x2019; Probably emptying his drinks cabinet, as well.</p><p>Burton&#x2019;s intake was prodigious. At the height of his boozing in the mid-70s he was knocking back three to four bottles of hard liquor a day. On The Klansman he was drunk for the entire production. &#x2018;I barely recall making that film,&#x2019; he confessed. Burton loved the sheer sociability of booze, drinking in pubs, talking with mates and sharing stories; he was a man who enjoyed life better with a glass in his hand. After sex it was the thing he loved most in life. Coupled with his nicotine addiction &#x2013; it&#x2019;s rumoured he smoked 50 a day &#x2013; Burton embraced that seemingly inbred Celtic desire to walk dangerously close to the precipice perhaps more than anyone.</p><p>Harris too loved the communal nature of boozing. He loved nothing better than going into a pub on his own and by the end of the evening being surrounded by a new gang of boisterous pals. &#x2018;Men, not women,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d state. &#x2018;Boozing is a man&#x2019;s world.&#x2019; For years Harris habitually drank two bottles of vodka a day. &#x2018;That would take me up to seven in the evening, then I&#x2019;d break open a bottle of brandy and a bottle of port and mix the two.&#x2019; Asked by a reporter once to describe how much booze he&#x2019;d consumed over his lifetime Harris was only exaggerating mildly when he replied. &#x2018;I could sail the QE2 to the Falklands on all the liquor I drank.&#x2019;</p><p>There was also an element of being the naughty schoolboy about Harris&#x2019;s drinking, of showing off. &#x2018;I adored getting drunk and I adored reading in the papers what I had done the night before.&#x2019; He knew full well what he was doing by getting pissed all the time and ending up in police cells or brawling in public, but didn&#x2019;t think it that awful. Neither did he hate himself for it in the morning or feel guilty. No, Harris just believed that the world and too many people in it were boring old farts and his mission was to live life to the fullest and spread a little joy around. &#x2018;So I did, and damn the consequences.&#x2019;</p><p>O&#x2019;Toole was another who loved the social life of a drinker, propping up bars in Dublin or London, nattering with saloon-bar poets and philosophers, putting the world to rights. &#x2018;But I don&#x2019;t really know what I get out of it,&#x2019; he once said. &#x2018;What does anyone get out of being drunk? It&#x2019;s an anaesthetic. It diminishes the pain.&#x2019; O&#x2019;Toole would drink to excess for no good reason, as he became intoxicated quite quickly due to the delicate state of his insides; he suffered from ill health most of his life, particularly from intestinal pain.</p><p>Naturally eccentric, the drink merely compounded the affliction, and fame when it came threw a spotlight on it so all the world could gawp and gasp at his escapades. This was a man who travelled the world yet never wore a watch or carried a wallet. Nor upon leaving home did he ever take his keys with him. &#x2018;I just hope some bastard&#x2019;s in.&#x2019; More than once, on the occasions when someone was not, O&#x2019;Toole had to explain to the police why he should be breaking into his own property.</p><p>There was an undercurrent of violence to his drinking, too. At his hellraising peak the gossip columns were filled with accounts of booze-fuelled antics: a brawl with paparazzi on the Via Veneto in Rome, a fistfight with a French count in a restaurant, his fleeing Italy on the eve of being arrested, even the beating up of a policeman. O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s social life often was in danger of eclipsing his talent. &#x2018;I was silly and young and drunken and making a complete clown of myself. But I did quite enjoy the days when one went for a beer at one&#x2019;s local in Paris and woke up in Corsica.&#x2019;</p><p>For Reed, like Burton and Harris, it wasn&#x2019;t so much drinking he loved but the fact that it took place in pubs. He loved the companionship, the camaraderie with other men, the chance to challenge people to drink contests or bouts of arm wrestling. All his life he preferred the friendships he made in pubs to those on a film set. &#x2018;You meet a better class of person in pubs.&#x2019;</p><p>He also loved the loss of inhibitions in a person when they drank and so found great sport in getting anyone in his vicinity totally smashed. &#x2018;People make so much more sense when they&#x2019;re drunk and you can get along famously with people you couldn&#x2019;t bear at other times.&#x2019; Journalists who visited him were invariably plied with unhealthy amounts of drink and staggered home after the encounter with the battle scars of a war correspondent.</p><p>Reed was proud of the fact that he could drink any man under the table. His favourite tipple was &#x2018;gunk&#x2019;, his own invention, an ice bucket with every drink in the bar poured into it. The Daily Mirror reported a doctor&#x2019;s findings that the safe limit for any man&#x2019;s consumption of alcohol was four pints a day, and then printed a story that Reed had managed to knock back 126 pints of beer in 24 hours and photographed him performing a victory horizontal hand-stand across the bar.</p><p>Reed&#x2019;s antics were perhaps unmatched by any other hellraiser &#x2013; and they are legion. He once arrived at Galway airport lying drunk on a baggage conveyor. On an international flight he incurred the wrath of the pilot by dropping his trousers and asking the air hostesses to judge a prettiest boy contest. All this led one journalist to say that calling Oliver Reed unpredictable was like calling Ivan the Terrible &#x2018;colourful&#x2019;.</p><p>All these men played up to their boozy, brawling, madcap image; some resented the press label of hellraiser, others wallowed in it, turning it almost into a badge of honour and a second career. &#x2018;What that group of actors had was a fine madness, a lyrical madness,&#x2019; said Harris. &#x2018;We lived our life with that madness and it was transmitted into our work. We had smiles on our faces and a sense that the world was mad. We weren&#x2019;t afraid to be different. So we were always dangerous. Dangerous to meet in the street, in a restaurant, and dangerous to see on stage or in a film.&#x2019;</p><p>Director Peter Medak recognizes that this element of danger was a significant part of the hellraiser&#x2019;s make-up. &#x2018;It was the same with Burton and O&#x2019;Toole, and Harris and Reed, there was this terrible sense of danger around them, you didn&#x2019;t know if they were going to kiss you, hug you or punch you right in the face. They were just wonderful.&#x2019;</p><p>HELLRAISERS.

There is the sense of the speaker as a cartographer of familiar spaces, of land he has never left or relationships that have stayed with him for years, and always with the newness of an alien or stranger. Acutely attuned to the heritage of Greco-Roman myth, Wilson writes through characters such as the Basilisk and the Minotaur, emphasizing the intense loneliness these characters experience from their uniqueness. For the racially ambiguous speaker of these poems, who is both black and not black, who has lived between the American South and the Midwest, there are no easy answers. From the fields of Kentucky to the pigeon coops of Chicago, identities and locations blur&#x2015;the pastoral bleeds into the Afrofuturist, black into white and back again.</p><p>Keith S.

Radical, thought-provoking, and indeed mind-boggling, it leads to a completely new way of looking at what it means to be human - a spiritual being in a universe that itself is not just physical, but psychic and spiritual as well. These three previously untranslated lectures are a masterly introduction to what Rudolf Steiner means by &#x201c;anthroposophy.&#x201d; They explain why Steiner describes this path-which means literally &#x201c;the wisdom of the human being&#x201d;- as one that &#x201c;unites what is spiritual in the human being with what is spiritual in the universe.&#x201d; Steiner begins by describing what happens when we die. He shows the relationship between our physical life on earth and the etheric, astral, and spiritual life of the cosmos. He also explains how physical lives are completely interwoven with cosmic existence, and how the &#x201c;miss�ing links&#x201d; in evolution are spiritual in nature. Steiner then demonstrates what he calls the &#x201c;dilettantism&#x201d; and &#x201c;soullessness&#x201d; of mainstream psychology. He points out that since the second half of the nineteenth century the idea of the soul has been lost, and that, consequently, understanding of our inner lives is without a sure foundation. A quite different view, however, emerges from a truly spiritual perspective. In the third lec�ture, Steiner takes as his guide our three states of being - waking, dreaming, and sleeping. He describes in detail what happens in these three states, and how each is bound up with our lives as physical, psychic, and spiritual beings. With the profound insights in this book, the world becomes a much larger, richer, and more exciting place to live.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>In Defense Of Food</h2><p>From the author of the bestselling The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma comes this bracing and eloquent manifesto that shows readers how they might start making thoughtful food choices that can enrich their lives and enlarge their sense of what it means to be healthy. (Consumer Health)</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, January 2008</b>: Food is the one thing that Americans hate to love and, as it turns out, love to hate. What we want to eat has been ousted by the notion of what we <i>should</i> eat, and it's at this nexus of hunger and hang-up that Michael Pollan poses his most salient question: where is the food in our food? What follows in <i>In Defense of Food</i> is a series of wonderfully clear and thoughtful answers that help us omnivores navigate the nutritional minefield that's come to typify our food culture. Many processed foods vie for a spot in our grocery baskets, claiming to lower cholesterol, weight, glucose levels, you name it. Yet Pollan shows that these convenient "healthy" alternatives to whole foods are appallingly inconvenient: our health has a nation has only deteriorated since we started exiling carbs, fats--even fruits--from our daily meals. His razor-sharp analysis of the American diet (as well as its architects and its detractors) offers an inspiring glimpse of what it would be like if we could (a la Humpty Dumpty) put our food back together again and reconsider what it means to eat well. In a season filled with rallying cries to lose weight and be healthy, Pollan's call to action&#x2014;"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."--is a program I actually want to follow.<i> --Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br>Michael Pollan is the author of five books: <i>Second Nature</i>, <i>A Place of My Own</i>, <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, which received the Borders Original Voices Award for the best nonfiction work of 2001 and was recognized as a best book of the year by the American Booksellers Association and Amazon, and the national bestellers, <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i>, and <i>In Defense of Food</i>.<p>A longtime contributing writer to <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, Pollan is also the Knight Professor of Journalism at UC Berkeley. His writing on food and agriculture has won numerous awards, including the Reuters/World Conservation Union Global Award in Environmental Journalism, the James Beard Award, and the Genesis Award from the American Humane Association.</p></p><h2>A Guide to Christian Spiritual Formation: How Scripture, Spirit, Community, and Mission Shape Our Souls</h2><p>Evan Howard, a noted authority on Christian spirituality, provides a holistic, accessible, and informed introduction to Christian spiritual formation written from a broadly evangelical perspective.

By appointing respected longtime reformer John Githongo as anticorruption czar, the new Kikuyu government signaled its determination to end the corrupt practices that had tainted the previous regime. Yet only two years later, Githongo himself was on the run, having secretly compiled evidence of official malfeasance throughout the new administration. Unable to remain silent, Githongo, at great personal risk, made the painful choice to go public. The result was a Kenyan Watergate. </p> <p> Michela Wrong's account of how a pillar of the establishment turned whistle-blower�becoming simultaneously one of the most hated and admired men in Kenya�grips like a political thriller while probing the very roots of the continent's predicament. </p></p><p><p>Michela Wrong has worked as a foreign correspondent for Reuters, the BBC, and the <em>Financial Times</em>. She has written about Africa for Slate.com and is a frequent commentator on African affairs in the media. Her first book, <em>In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz</em>, won the James Stern Silver Pen Award for Nonfiction. She lives in London.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Accompanying the fanfare of President Obama's visit to Ghana in July was a chorus of well-founded praise for that country's functioning democracy. The U.S. president pointed to his host country as a shining example, while warning other nations on the continent that "Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions." Political pundits and the media reinforced Obama's message, holding up Ghana as Africa's success story. Not so long ago, Ghana shared the limelight with Kenya, the country of Obama's paternal past. But the vote-tampering and widespread ethnic violence that marred the 2007 Kenyan elections left observers shaking their heads, wondering how the idyll of East Africa could have gone so wrong, so quickly. A well-functioning, multiparty government buoyed by an impressive 6 percent annual growth rate had made for a potent combination in the post-colonial dream world. The blurring of fantasy and reality, however, was laid bare in the smoldering rubble of election violence that left some 1,500 Kenyans dead and at least 300,000 internally displaced. Journalist Michela Wrong provides a very important and illuminating account of Kenya's present-day political and economic morass. On one level, "It's Our Turn to Eat" reads like a John le Carr� novel as it traces the cloak-and-dagger maneuverings of Kenya's political bosses, and the heroic but futile attempts of John Githongo -- the government's internal, anti-corruption watchdog, and the protagonist of Wrong's account -- to stymie them. On a deeper and much richer level, the book is an analysis of how and why Kenya descended into political violence more than a year and a half ago. For Wrong, the insidious bedfellows of corruption and tribalism inhabit nearly every sphere of Kenyan existence. At the upper echelons of government, members of parliament connived to defraud the country of some $750 million through the notorious Anglo-Leasing scheme; at the lower levels of society, the ordinary Kenyan doles out on average 16 bribes a month to government agents simply to get by. These factors, as Wrong points out, have been present in Kenya since the inauguration of the country's first independent government in 1963, despite the rather rosy and misplaced image that characterized the nation, at least in the Western media, for decades. First, under the leadership of Jomo Kenyatta, the Kikuyu, Kenya's ethnic majority, benefited disproportionately from the state's spoils. Kenyatta surrounded himself with a coterie of loyal ethnic supporters who systematically excluded non-Kikuyu from participating in their quest for power and ill-gotten wealth. Subsequently, when Daniel T. arap Moi took power in 1978, the new president continued with the tribally based corruption. Only this time, Moi, who came from the ethnic-minority Kalenjin of western Kenya, redirected the flow of wealth and power to his tribal base of supporters. For the Kalenjin and other closely related tribes, it was their turn to eat. It was Githongo -- a Western-educated, physically imposing and exceedingly shrewd man -- who was to herald the literal and symbolic end to this vicious cycle of corruption and ethnic favoritism. When Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, took presidential power in 2002, he declared his election a mandate for reform and appointed the young Githongo, also a Kikuyu, to root out the old bogies that had undermined Kenya's progress. It wasn't long, though, before Githongo's starry eyes cleared, only to find his revered mentor, Kibaki, knee-deep in the corruption game, with a supporting cast of legislators aiding and abetting theft from the state's coffers. With much drama, Githongo eventually fled Kenya, taking with him piles of documents and secretly taped conversations. He landed on the London doorstep of Wrong, an old acquaintance. Given this personal connection, Wrong is notably self-aware of her position as both author and partial subject of her own book. Indeed, her personal involvement scarcely compromises her excellent analysis of Kenya's twin evils; rather, she deftly points to the fact that corruption and tribalism are not endemic just to Africa, but inhabit the contemporary, worldwide landscape, and that complicity reaches to all corners of the globe as well. If the old-boy system is not an African artifact, and if undemocratic processes have no boundaries -- many a Kenyan will snicker at the mention of a hanging chad -- how then does Wrong make sense of the localized events in Kenya? By "probing the roots of a dysfunctional African nation" and its British colonial legacy, as well as Kenya's more recent entanglements with the likes of the World Bank and Britain's Department for International Development, Wrong takes a decidedly Paul Wolfowitz-like stand. That is, political systems are at the heart of the problem and must be reformed if there is any hope for the alleviation of poverty -- and not just in Kenya. It's difficult to argue against Wrong on this point, though the roots and solutions to Kenya's problems are far more embedded in the country's past than she suggests. Colonial Kenya -- with its white tribe of settlers and administrators, economic monopolies and perpetuation of African tribalism, and a governor who ruled with highly centralized powers and a posse of loyal underlings to support him -- bears an uncanny resemblance to the country today. Moreover, while Wrong praises Britain's former highest-ranking ambassador to Kenya, High Commissioner Edward Clay, and his anti-corruption stance, she fails to mention that, while Clay was making his strongest denunciations of corruption, the full impact of Britain's colonial violence and coverups was finally being disclosed in Kenya. Britain's colonial legacy has undermined its moral authority and continues to influence processes in Kenya, no matter how complicit Africans have been in perpetuating corruption and tribalism. The historical phenomenon of colonialism and its long-term impact vary across the continent, making the trajectory of a former settler colony such as Kenya distinct from that of Ghana, and many other African nations, for that matter. If strongmen are to be eliminated and institutions reformed -- as both Obama and Wrong urge -- then the historical differences among various African countries, and the ways in which these differences inform and shape present-day governing structures and cultures, must be thoroughly understood. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

A free eBook version is available at the author's web site.) By the co-author of the popular book "How Statin Drugs Really Lower Cholesterol (And Kill You One Cell at a Time)": Here is PROOF that Sjogren's is caused by fungal toxins like statin drugs and other fungal-like toxins from H. pylori infection. To accept this evidence requires the courage to disagree with conventional thinking about Sjogren's. The other choice is to curse the messenger or accept the old paradigms that do not cure. Many drugs derived from fungal toxins (mycotoxins), like statins, are clearly linked to Sjogren's Syndrome. If autoimmune illnesses like Sjogren's and Lupus are caused by toxin-making infections inside cells, then anti-malarial antibiotics like Plaquenil should have some positive effect (as malaria infects the inside of cells) -- and do! On the other hand, in the face of real infection, drugs to suppress the immune system are like shutting off the water supply used by firemen trying to put out a complex fire. This also violates the medical ethic: "First, do no harm". This book is not a recounting of available conventional treatment driven by for-profit drug companies but is, rather, a whole new convention. For those who truly want health restored rather than the current downward spiral, they will find the strength to change their minds -- one of the most difficult things for anyone to do once a mainstream mindset is made on a matter. Dr. Yoseph explains how Sjogren's is not a diagnosis but a description, and without a proper diagnosis there can be no remedy. Toxic drugs to suppress painful symptoms are the best that modern medicine can offer in its current system of belief. Here, layers of evidence are provided to unlock the so-called mystery of Sjogren's. Be ready to open your eyes (some will not because they can not change their minds), as remedy is made straightforward when the axe is taken to the root of the tree. The Sjogren's protocols herein, nevertheless, will not be supported by your physician or your mother as Dr. Hannah Yoseph clearly contradicts the "experts" who sometimes challenge her "credentials" (retired general physician) rather than investigate the evidence she has gathered from the public record and practice. In this book she explores Sjogren's at the causal level and again consolidates the science from all over the world: deadly fungal toxins cause Sjogren's. Hannah Yoseph explores the lost science and offers a chance for the suffering and weary. It is a must read for the patient, family and friends. In beautiful concise and simple prose she points the way for patients and researchers alike. It is time for medicine to return to its roots: the art and science of healing without harm rather than promoting drug company interests to "treat" a so-called incurable disease forever rather than cure. Dare to dump the acid-making soft drinks, dare to be well, stump your physician and stomp out Sj�gren's &#x2013; for life!</p><p></p><h2>Real Love in Parenting: Nine Simple and Powerfully Effective Principles for Raising Happy and Responsible Children</h2><p><b>"I was at my wits' end.

Deer begins, &#x201c;I was born a Menominee Indian. That is who I was born and how I have lived.&#x201d; She proceeds to narrate the first eighty-three years of her life, which are characterized by her tireless campaigns to reverse the forced termination of the Menominee tribe and to ensure sovereignty and self-determination for all tribes.<br><br> Deer grew up in poverty on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, but with the encouragement of her mother and teachers, she earned degrees in social work from the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison and Columbia University. Armed with a first-rate education, an iron will, and a commitment to justice, she went from being a social worker in Minneapolis to leading the struggle for the restoration of the Menominees&#x2019; tribal status and trust lands.<br><br> Having accomplished that goal, she moved on to teach American Indian Studies at UW&#x2013;Madison, to hold a fellowship at Harvard, to work for the Native American Rights Fund, to run unsuccessfully for Congress, and to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs in the Clinton administration.<br><br> Now in her eighties, Deer remains as committed as ever to human rights, especially the rights of American Indians.

Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were intellectuals&#x2014;too smart, they believed, for the police to catch them. When they were apprehended, state's attorney Robert Crowe was certain that no defense could save the ruthless killers from the gallows.

They were intelligent and had already graduated from first-class colleges. Yet on May 21, 1924, they did something appalling: They kidnapped a 14-year-old student named Bobby Franks, murdered him, dumped his body in a drainage ditch at Wolf Lake, several miles southeast of Chicago, and then tried to extract $10,000 in ransom from his parents. </p><p>Why did they do it? Less than two weeks later, after confessing to the crime, Leopold spoke to the state's attorney for Cook County and three psychiatrists. He said: </p><p>"I am sure, as sure as I can be of anything, that is, as sure as you can read any other man's state of mind, the thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement, or the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different; possibly . . . the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over. . . . The money consideration only came in afterwards, and never was important. The getting of the money was a part of our objective, as was also the commission of the crime; but that was not the exact motive." </p><p> The scheme was Loeb's. As a boy his "real passion . . . was for crime stories and detective mysteries," and as he grew older that passion only intensified. After he and Leopold carried out a petty robbery as a test of their criminal skills, he proposed that "they should commit a perfect crime, a crime so intricate and complicated that planning and calculating its flawless execution would be a challenge. . . . They should kidnap a child, he proposed, and to increase the intricacy of the crime, they should demand a ransom from the child's parents. The money was important, not for its own sake, but to magnify the complexity of the crime. . . . It was to be a brilliant crime, he mused, one that would shock Chicago with its daring. They would obtain the ransom, dispose of the body, and leave no clues behind; the police would never catch them." </p><p>It didn't quite work out that way. Three days after his murder, Bobby Franks's body was discovered by "a recent immigrant from Poland who worked as a pump man for the American Maize Company," and a week later Leopold and Loeb were taken into custody; they had left plenty of clues. The crime, the arrests of the privileged youths and the subsequent trial aroused the nation's attention much as did another famous case of the 1920s, the trial of the anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti for the killings of a paymaster and a guard during a payroll robbery in Massachusetts. The Leopold and Loeb case had no political overtones, as the Sacco and Vanzetti case had, and -- somewhat surprisingly, given prevailing attitudes of the time -- anti-Semitism does not seem to have been a significant contributor to public outrage over it, but it caught popular attention much as the O.J. Simpson case did seven decades later. </p><p>Zillions of words have been written about Sacco and Vanzetti, not to mention O.J. Simpson, yet as Simon Baatz points out in For the Thrill of It, "although the Leopold-Loeb case was one of the most infamous murders of the twentieth century, historians have largely ignored it." It has been the subject of novels (most notably Compulsion, by Meyer Levin) and the basis for movies (most notably Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope"). But when, several years ago, Baatz learned about the case for the first time, "no one had yet written a book that considered the episode in its complexity and intricacy." Hal Higdon published The Crime of the Century: The Leopold and Loeb Case in 1975, but it is little more than pop history. </p><p>Baatz -- formerly of George Mason University, now associate professor of history at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York -- has written a narrative history that aims, he says, "to recapture the drama of the events that it describes" but also to deal with the "complex issues that give the subject its significance." By and large he has succeeded. The book is overly long; presented with voluminous court documents, journalistic accounts and other raw material, Baatz sometimes quotes to excess. But For the Thrill of It is meticulous and thorough, and it puts the case in historical perspective as a clash between two conflicting views of criminals and crime, one espoused by Robert Crowe, the state's attorney, and the other by Clarence Darrow, who represented Nathan Leopold and was the most famous American lawyer of his day, perhaps indeed of any day. </p><p> "Criminals," Crowe believed, "were fully responsible for their actions and should be treated accordingly -- it was foolishness to absolve them of blame for their misdeeds." By contrast, Darrow was a "determinist" who believed that "the criminal did not freely choose wrongdoing; rather, factors outside his or her conscious control acted to determine criminal behavior. There was no such thing as individual responsibility. Imprisonment was futile and even counterproductive; it served no purpose either as a deterrent or as a punishment." Baatz continues: </p><p>"The trial of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb would be a contest between two charismatic individuals -- Darrow, who had built his reputation by defending unpopular causes; and Crowe, the most competent and energetic state's attorney in a generation. And there would be a second contest, a contest between opposing philosophies of crime and punishment. Which one would triumph?" </p><p>As it happens, neither side won a clear victory. Darrow and the lawyers for Richard Loeb decided before the trial began that it would be hopeless to plead not guilty by reason of insanity because "neither Nathan nor Richard was legally insane." So the not-guilty plea was withdrawn. The youths pled guilty. Their only hope was to be spared the gallows. To that end Darrow told the court, "The statute provides that evidence may be offered in mitigation of the punishment and we shall ask at such time as the court may direct that we may be permitted to offer evidence as to the mental condition of these young men, to show the degree of responsibility they had and also to offer evidence as to the youth of these defendants and the fact of a plea of guilty as further mitigation of the penalties in this case." Darrow, Baatz writes, "needed only to persuade the judge that they were mentally ill -- a medical condition, not at all equivalent or comparable to insanity -- to obtain a reduction in their sentence. And Darrow needed only one reduction -- from death by hanging to life in prison -- to win his case." </p><p>The irony is that though Darrow won in the immediate sense -- the youths were sentenced to life in prison -- he failed to win the broader legal and philosophical argument. That one was left unresolved. The judge reached his decision because "the court is moved chiefly by the consideration of the age of the defendants." Darrow and his associates had presented a formidable amount of evidence about the defendants' upbringing, psychological makeup and relationship with each other, including homosexual activities. Yet in the end, none of it amounted to anything. Darrow didn't keep Leopold and Loeb away from the gallows; a slightly soft-hearted judge did, and in doing so he said: "Life imprisonment may not, at the moment, strike the public imagination as forcibly as would death by hanging but to the offenders, particularly of the type they are, the prolonged suffering of years of confinement may well be the severer form of retribution and expiation." </p><p>Loeb lasted only until January 1936, when he was brutally stabbed and slashed to death by an inmate to whom he had made repeated sexual overtures. Leopold made it all the way to February 1958, when he was paroled. He moved to Puerto Rico, married, and, after he won his release from parole five years later, traveled frequently and visited old friends in Chicago. He died in August 1971. </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

In <i>Storms of My Grandchildren</i>, Hansen speaks out for the first time with the full truth about global warming: The planet is hurtling even more rapidly than previously acknowledged to a climatic point of no return. In explaining the science of climate change, Hansen paints a devastating but all-too-realistic picture of what will happen in our children's and grandchildren's lifetimes if we follow the course we're on.

Meet Gus, a one-time orphan who goes through life thinking that hurtful words and actions are the only way to behave and communicate with others. Interestingly, Gus lives in a town that holds a mysterious secret which finally gets unlocked by something that was hidden away. By unlocking this secret, you too can join the ripple effect of kindness that Gus, along with his school and town, is experiencing with the rest of the world! This book, along with each of you, will change our world as we know it. It only takes <i>One Drop of Kindness to fill a heart with love.</i></p><p>My belief is that kindness is an essential ingredient missing from today&#39;s society. If we all take the time to think before we speak and act, and use kindness to help inform our decisions, the world will become a much better place.There is too much hatred and wrong doing throughout our amazing planet.

He had even danced joyfully with the scrolls at Simchat Torah, if only for a few minutes. But, now that those holy days were over, the vital energy had departed from him. On this sultry, overripe September day, with the windows closed and sweat beading on the brow of every member of the congregation, the Rav, leaning on the arm of his nephew Dovid, was wrapped in a woollen overcoat. His voice was faint. His hands shook.<br><br>The matter was clear. It had been clear for some time. For months his voice, once as rich as red kiddush wine, had been hoarse, sometimes cracking altogether into a harsh little cough or a deep fit of retching and choking. Still, it was hard to believe in a faint shadow on the lung. Who could see a shadow? What was a shadow? The congregation could not believe that Rav Krushka could succumb to a shadow&#x2014;he from whom the light of Torah seemed to shine so brightly that they felt themselves illuminated by his presence.<br><br>Rumors had spread across the community, were passed at chance meetings in the street. A Harley Street specialist had told him all would be well if he took a month&#x2019;s rest. A famous Rebbe had sent word that he and five hundred young Torah students recited the entire book of Psalms every day for Rav Krushka&#x2019;s safe recovery. The Rav, it was said, had received a prophetic dream declaring that he would live to see laid the first stone of the Bais HaMikdash, the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>And yet he grew more frail every day. His failing health became known across Hendon and farther afield. As is the way of things, congregants who once might have skipped a week in synagogue, or attended a different service, had become fervent in their devotions. Each week, more worshipers attended than the week before. The clumsy synagogue&#x2014;originally merely two semidetached houses knocked together and hollowed out&#x2014;was not designed for this quantity of people. The air became stale during services, the temperature even warmer, the scent almost fetid.<br><br>One or two members of the synagogue board suggested that perhaps they might arrange an alternative service to cater to the unusual numbers. Dr. Yitzchak Hartog, the president of the board, overruled them. These people had come to see the Rav, he declared, and see him they would.<br><br>So it was that on the first Shabbat after Simchat Torah, the synagogue was overfull, all members of the congregation fixing their attention, sad to say, more on the Rav himself than on the prayers they were addressing to their Maker. Throughout that morning, they watched him anxiously. It was true that Dovid was by his uncle&#x2019;s side, holding the siddur for him, supporting him by his right elbow. But, one murmured to another, perhaps the presence of such a man would hinder rather than help his recovery? Dovid was a Rabbi, this much was admitted, but he was not a Rav. The distinction was subtle, for one may become a Rabbi simply through study and achievement, but the title Rav is given by a community to a beloved leader, a guiding light, a scholar of unsurpassed wisdom. Rav Krushka was all these things without doubt. But had Dovid ever spoken in public or given a magnificent d&#x2019;var Torah, let alone written a book of inspiration and power, as the Rav had? No, no, and no. Dovid was unprepossessing to the sight: short, balding, a little overweight, but more than that, he had none of the Rav&#x2019;s spirit, none of his fire. Not a single member of the congregation, down to the tiniest child, would address Dovid Kuperman as &#x201c;Rabbi.&#x201d; He was &#x201c;Dovid,&#x201d; or sometimes, simply, &#x201c;that nephew of the Rav, that assistant.&#x201d; And as for his wife! It was understood that all was not well with Esti Kuperman, that there was some problem there, some trouble. But such matters fall under the name of lashon hara&#x2014;an evil tongue&#x2014;and should not even be whispered in the holy house of the Lord.<br><br>In any case, Dovid was agreed to be no fitting support for the Rav. The Rav should be surrounded by men of great Torah learning, who might study night and day, and thus avert the evil decree. A pity, said some, that the Rav had no son to learn in his name and thus merit him a longer life. A pity, too, said others, more quietly, that the Rav had no son to be Rav when he was gone. For who would take his place? These thoughts had circulated for months, becoming more distinct in the synagogue&#x2019;s dry heat. And as the Rav&#x2019;s energy had drained from him, Dovid, too, had become a little more bowed with every passing week, as though he felt the weight of their stares upon his shoulders, and the force of their disappointment crushing his chest. He rarely looked up during the service now, and said nothing, continuing to turn the pages of the siddur, focusing only on the words of prayer.<br><br>By midmorning, it was clear to all the men that the Rav was worse than they had seen him before. They bent their necks around the corners where fireplaces and built-in larders had once stood and shuffled their plastic chairs a little closer to him, to observe him more exactly, to will him on. Through the morning service of Shacharit, the room grew warmer and warmer, and each man became aware that, even through his suit trousers, he had begun to stick to his seat. The Rav bowed low during Modim, then straightened again, but they could see that his hand gripping the bench in front of him was white and trembled. And his face, though determined, faltered into a grimace with every movement.<br><br>Even the women, observing the service from the upper gallery built around three sides of the room, peering through the net curtain, could see that the Rav&#x2019;s strength was almost gone. When the aron was opened, the Torah scrolls exhaled a fragrant cedar breath into the faces of the congregation, which seemed to rouse him, and he stood. But when the cabinet was closed his sitting seemed a surrender to gravity rather than a decided motion. He released the energy that had supported him and fell into his seat. By the time the Torah portion was half read, every member of the congregation was willing Rav Krushka to take each rasping, painful breath. If Dovid had not been there, the Rav would have slumped over in his place. Even the women could see that.<br><br>Esti Kuperman watched the service from the women&#x2019;s gallery. Each week a place of honor was reserved for her, in the front row, by the net curtain. In truth, the front row was never occupied at all, even at such times as these, when every seat was needed. Women would stand at the back of the gallery, rather than take one of those front-row seats. Each week Esti sat alone, never bending her thin neck, not showing by any word or glance that she had noted the empty seats on either side of her. She took the position in the front row because it was expected. She was Dovid&#x2019;s wife. Dovid sat next to the Rav. If the Rav&#x2019;s wife had not passed on, Esti would have been at her side. When, God willing, they were blessed with children, they would accompany her. As it was, she sat alone.<br><br>Farther back in the women&#x2019;s section nothing could be seen of the service at all. For the women in those seats only the melodies penetrated, as in the chambers of Heaven, whose doors open only to voices raised in song. Esti, though, could observe the crowns of the heads below, each covered by an oval of hat or decorated with a round circle of kippah. Over time the hats and kippot had become individual to her, each blotch of color representing a different personality. There was Hartog, the president of the board, solidly built and muscular, walking up and down even while the prayers continued, occasionally exchanging a word with another congregant. There was Levitsky, the synagogue treasurer, swaying in a nervous pecking motion as he prayed. There was Kirschbaum, one of the executive officers, leaning against the wall and constantly dozing off and waking with a jerk. She watched them come and go, ascend the steps to the bimah, and return to their places, where they&#x2019;d stand and rock gently in place. She felt a strange sort of disconnection. At times, when she was staring down, the movements seemed like some game played on a checkerboard&#x2014;round pieces advancing purposefully but without meaning. In the past she had often found herself becoming lulled into a trancelike state by the familiar melodies, the unchanging pattern of movement below, so that she would scarcely notice when the service was over and would be shocked to find the women around her already wishing her a Good Shabbos, the men below already drifting from view. Once or twice she had found herself standing in what seemed to be an empty synagogue, afraid to turn around for fear that some of the women might remain, behind her, whispering.<br><br>On this Shabbat, though, she restrained herself. Like the rest of the congregation, she sat when the Torah scrolls, clothed in regal velvet, were returned to the aron at the front. Like the rest, she waited patiently for the leader of the Shacharit service to step down from the bimah and the leader of the next service, Mussaf, to step up. Like the rest, she was puzzled when, after five minutes had passed, Mussaf had not yet started. She peered through the net curtain, trying to discern what was happening below. She blinked. On her husband&#x2019;s arm, the hunched figure of the Rav, clad in his black overcoat, was making his way slowly to the bimah.<br><br>In earlier times, the Rav would have addressed them at this point in the service, taking the Torah portion they had just read and weaving it, with other sources, into an intricate and beautiful lesson. But it had been many months since he had spoken to them like that. This week, as for so many weeks now, a copy of one of his previous sermons had been left on each seat. The Rav was not well enough to speak. And yet, in the men&#x2019;s section beneath her, he was ascending the three steps to the podium. A rustle of voices rose up around the synagogue and fell silent. The Rav would speak.<br><br>The Rav raised his arm, thin and pale in the sleeve of the coat. When he spoke, his voice was unexpectedly strong. He had been an orator all his life; the people did not need to strain to catch his words. &#x201c;I will speak,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;only for a moment. I have not been well. With Hashem&#x2019;s help, I will recover.&#x201d; There was a vigorous burst of nodding around the room; several people clapped and were swiftly quieted, for theater applause has no place in a synagogue.<br><br>&#x201c;Speech,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If the created world were a piece of music, speech would be its refrain, its recurring theme. In the Torah, we read that Hashem created the world through speech. He could have willed it into existence. We might read: &#x2018;And God thought of light, and there was light.&#x2019; No. He could have hummed it. Or formed it from clay in His hands. Or breathed it out. Hashem, our King, the Holy One Blessed Be He, did none of these things. To create the world, He spoke. &#x2018;And God said, let there be light, and there was light.&#x2019; Exactly as He spoke, so it was.&#x201d;<br><br>The Rav broke off, coughing violently, a sickly bubbling sound in his chest. Several of the men strained to move to him, but he waved them back. He supported himself on Dovid&#x2019;s shoulder, gave three sharp coughs, and fell silent. He breathed heavily and continued.<br><br>&#x201c;The Torah itself. A book. Hashem could have given us a painting, or a sculpture, a forest, a creature, an idea in our minds to explain His world. But He gave us a book. Words.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused and looked around the hall, scanning the silent faces. When the pause had gone on just a little too long, the Rav raised his hand and banged it loudly on the lectern.<br><br>&#x201c;What a great power the Almighty has given us! To speak, as He speaks! Astonishing! Of all the creatures on earth, only we can speak. What does this mean?&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled faintly and looked around the room once more.<br><br>&#x201c;It means we have a hint of Hashem&#x2019;s power. Our words are, in a sense, real. They can create worlds and destroy them. They have edges, like a knife.&#x201d; The Rav brought his arm around in a sweeping motion, as though wielding a scythe. He smiled. &#x201c;Of course, our power is not Hashem&#x2019;s power. Let us not forget that, either. Our words are more than empty breath, but they are not Torah. Torah contains the world. Torah is the world. Do not forget, my children, that all of our words, all of our stories, can only, at best, amount to a commentary on a single verse of the Torah.&#x201d;<br><br>The Rav turned to Dovid and whispered a few words. Together, the two men walked down from the bimah and back to their seats. The congregation was silent. At last, gathering himself, the chazzan began to pray the Mussaf service.<br><br>The Rav&#x2019;s words had clearly weighed with the chazzan leading the prayers, for the man seemed to be paying peculiar attention to each letter, each syllable of every word. He spoke slowly, but clearly and with power, as though he were hearing and appreciating the words for the first time. &#x201c;Mechalkel chayim b&#x2019;chesed,&#x201d; he said. (&#x201c;He sustains all living things with kindness, He gives the dead life with abundant mercy.&#x201d;) The congregation responded in kind, their responses becoming louder and clearer until they were speaking with one great voice.<br><br>As the chazzan reached the kedushah, he began to sweat, his face was pale. &#x201c;Na&#x2019;aritzecha v&#x2019;Nakdishecha...&#x201d; he declared.<br><br>&#x201c;Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh,&#x201d; (&#x201c;Holy, holy holy is the Lord&#x201d;) the people responded, raising themselves onto the balls of their feet, many feeling a little light-headed, perhaps through the heat.<br><br>And it was at that moment, when all were reaching up on their tiptoes to the Almighty, that a crash resounded in the hall, as though one of the mighty cedars of Lebanon had fallen. The men turned and the women craned. The congregation saw Rav Krushka, lying on his side, by his seat. He let out a long moan, but there was no movement in him except his left leg, twitching against the wooden bench, the knocks sounding loud and hollow around the synagogue.<br><br>There was a moment of quiet and a sensation of pressure beating at the temples.<br><br>Hartog was the first to recover. He ran to the Rav, pushing Dovid to one side. He loosened the Rav&#x2019;s tie and took his arm, shouting, &#x201c;Call an ambulance and bring blankets!&#x201d; The other men looked confused for a moment. The very words &#x201c;call an ambulance,&#x201d; uttered in the Rav&#x2019;s synagogue, on the Sabbath, seemed unreal; it was as though they&#x2019;d been asked for a slice of bacon, a pint of prawns. After a long moment, two of the young men started up and dashed toward the door, racing for the telephone.<br><br>High above, Esti Kuperman stood still, although some of the other women were already making their way downstairs to see what should be done.<br><br>Esti watched her husband take his uncle&#x2019;s hand and pat it, as though to comfort the old man. She noticed that Dovid&#x2019;s hair was thinner, seen from this angle, than she had thought. Some part of her noted, almost without intending to, that Hartog had already left the Rav&#x2019;s side, leaving his care to the other medical members of the congregation. That he had pulled three or four men of the synagogue board to one...</p><h2>Northern California Coast Note Card Box</h2><p>Heyday is proud to present two new note card sets that honor the Northern California coast and wooded mountains of Marin County near Tom Killion&#x2019;s studio.

In his twentieth season with the Villanova program, including a five-year stint as an assistant to Coach Rollie Massimino, Coach Jay Wright had achieved his lifelong dream&#x2014;and witnessed the culmination of a decades-long effort to build a culture of winning around a set of core values.<br><br> In <i>Attitude,</i> Coach Wright shares some of the leadership secrets that have enabled Villanova, a private university with an undergraduate enrollment of less than 6,500, to thrive in the hypercompetitive world of college athletics. As he recounts the story of the 2015&#x2013;16 Wildcats, Coach Wright offers anecdotes from his own journey up the ladder of success, with lessons learned on the Little League playing fields of his youth and wisdom passed down from his coaches and mentors.<br><br> Each step of Villanova&#x2019;s&nbsp;journey to a national championship incorporates a signature term torn from Coach Wright&#x2019;s own motivational playbook. Here are key principles that aspiring leaders can apply, not only on the basketball court but in the boardroom, the classroom, and the living room. From learning to accept your role to remembering to honor those who came before us, Jay Wright&#x2019;s core values provide a positive blueprint for transformational team building based on the idea that anyone&#x2014;from the head coach to the last player on the bench&#x2014;can be a leader when the moment demands it.<br><br> The product of a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of championship-level preparation, <i>Attitude</i> is perfect for anyone looking to build a team, achieve a goal, or nurture their own winning culture.<br><br><b>Praise for </b><i><b>Attitude</b><br><br></i>&#x201c;Jay Wright&#x2019;s <i>Attitude</i> is filled with wonderful anecdotes, life lessons, and that which we all seek: wisdom.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Phil Knight, co-founder and chairman emeritus, Nike</b><br><br> &#x201c;In 2015&#x2013;16, Villanova displayed the best attributes of a champion by playing hard, smart, and together.

For fans and the media and most people looking in from the out- side, it seems a season can only be called &#x201c;storybook&#x201d; if it comes complete with a storybook ending. In our basketball family, we don&#x2019;t see it that way. Not at all.<br><br> This may come as a surprise, but our big goal each year isn&#x2019;t to win the Championship. Our goal is something much simpler: We want to be the best team we can be by the end of the season. That&#x2019;s it. And at the end of the 2014&#x2013;2015 season, we were one heck of a good team.<br> Not to say that we don&#x2019;t want to win, or that a loss to a No. 8 seed in the second round of March Madness was what we were looking for. No one wants to lose. It&#x2019;s just that while the press and some fans described the end of our 2014&#x2013;2015 season like some sort of tragedy, it was my job to keep everyone in our program focused on how well we&#x2019;d played all year&#x2014;and to think about the lessons we could learn from our mistakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The World Evaluates on Its Own Terms.</b><br> <b>We Evaluate on Our Own.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Looking back on it, we really were having a storybook season.<br> Despite the graduation of James Bell and Tony Chennault, two pillars of our success during a 29&#x2013;5 campaign in 2013&#x2013;2014, we had made great strides on this 2014&#x2013;2015 journey. Darrun Hilliard and JayVaughn Pinkston had become true leaders as seniors in our pro- gram. Ryan Arcidiacono, Dylan Ennis, and Daniel Ochefu comprised our junior class. We started those five and relied on sophomores Josh Hart and Kris Jenkins, along with freshman Phil Booth, as key pieces for us off the bench. We had sophomore Darryl Reynolds ready on those nights when we needed help at the forward position too.<br><br> This was a deep team.<br><br> The group also displayed a toughness that I loved. Everyone on the roster was dialed into the tiny details that can spell the difference between victory and defeat. From the start of the season in Novem- ber and on through February, these young men established Villanova as a Top 10 team in both major polls. By March, we were in the Top 5 and considered a favorite to land a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tourna- ment.<br><br> Still, we hadn&#x2019;t taken home a Big East Tournament Championship since 1995. There are a lot of folks who downplay postseason confer- ence tournaments because they aren&#x2019;t the NCAA Tournament, but I&#x2019;ve never felt that way. I came of age coaching in the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, and I cherish being a part of the Big East Tournament. I knew how much that win would mean to our Villanova community.<br><br> On the final day of the regular season, we honored our last Big East Tournament champions during halftime of our game against Georgetown at the Wells Fargo Center, where both the 76ers and the Flyers play their home games. Many of the key people who had lifted Villanova to the top of the conference twenty years earlier&#x2014;head coach Steve Lappas, All-American Kerry Kittles, Jonathan Haynes, Jason Lawson, Alvin Williams, Eric Eberz, and Chuck Kornegay&#x2014; were there that day. To have those guys in the stands during our final game of the regular season was magic. We take pride in playing hard always, but I think the presence of that team gave us an extra boost of determination. And when the game ended, and we won, we invited all of those guys to join us on the court as we took hold of the Big East regular season championship trophy. What a special moment that was, to see our players mingling with those Wildcat heroes.<br> Tradition means everything at Villanova, and we honor it every chance we get. Our fans love to see the legends from years past, and we want our current players to appreciate that we are all part of something much larger than any one of us. Our performance that whole season was a continuation of the work those guys had put into their big win in &#x2019;95. Two decades after the fact, you could still see the rewards of that title written all over their smiling faces.<br><br> A week later, we walked into what has to be one of the greatest settings in all of sports, and certainly one of my personal favorites: Madison Square Garden on a Saturday night, playing for the Big East Championship. With the fire and spirit of the 1995 team fresh in our memories, we put an end to our long Big East Tournament Champi- onship drought with a 69&#x2013;52 win over Xavier.<br><br> That win was our fourteenth in a row and our thirty-second in thirty-four games. Like I said, it was a storybook season.<br><br> After the postgame press conference, as I walked into the spacious locker room that usually belongs to the New York Knicks, the team cheered and sprayed me with water. (They&#x2019;re too young for cham- pagne!) I emphasized the pride we as a staff took in the willingness of these young men to give wholly of themselves to our values. They in turn reveled in the simple pleasure of messing up their coach&#x2019;s hair.<br><br> The next day&#x2014;after a quick stop at the CBS studio to tape a seg- ment with Greg Gumbel, Clark Kellogg, Doug Gottlieb, and Seth Davis&#x2014;we met up with our charter bus to make the two-plus-hour drive back to the Main Line. (That&#x2019;s a common nickname for the area outside Philadelphia where Villanova is located.) Most college teams spend a whole lot of time on buses, and it&#x2019;s natural to develop a rap- port with the driver. At Villanova, there has been a long line of good people in that role, most notably the late &#x201c;Doc&#x201d; Dougherty, who skill- fully steered us throughout legendary Coach Rollie Massimino&#x2019;s ten- ure (1973&#x2013;1992). Our current steward of the roads is John Mills, a genial, deep-voiced man who has the perfect temperament for long hours at the wheel. As much as we as a coaching staff appreciate John, that is nothing compared to how the players view him. They absolutely love the guy, and you see it in their interactions with him every time they board the bus. On this day, John was as pumped up as any of our players, and he clearly wanted everything he did to re- flect the winning feeling our team was carrying.<br> Somehow, while we were up in the CBS studio, John had navigated Manhattan&#x2019;s crowded streets to find a primo parking space just a few steps from the front door at CBS. A bunch of us high-fived him as we climbed aboard, and in a matter of minutes we were through the Lincoln Tunnel and on our way. Unfortunately, after all of that, the bus broke down on the New Jersey Turnpike, but we barely minded. If you&#x2019;re going to have engine trouble, there is no better time for it than in the afterglow of a Big East Championship. Help arrived in no time, and we made it back to campus just in time for our NCAA Tournament Selection Sunday Watch Party.<br><br> The Selection Show event is something we all look forward to. We invite about five hundred people to join us in the Villanova Room, a large ballroom located in the Connelly Center, the main student cen- ter on campus. Included are the players&#x2019; and coaches&#x2019; families, Villa- nova staff, alumni, and students. There is a buffet dinner and then we all turn our attention to the giant television screens in each corner to watch the show. The media is there to chronicle our reactions, and in the wake of our Big East win, the excitement was even more pal- pable than usual. When the announcers started unveiling the bracket, one region at a time, the room fell silent and everyone stared at those TVs. When they got to the East Region, and announced that we&#x2019;d been seeded No. 1, you can imagine the scene: The cheers echoed off the walls, flew straight through the windows, and joined the chorus of cheers erupting from other buildings all over campus.<br> This was our tenth NCAA bid in eleven seasons, and as I stepped up to the lectern, I reminded everyone&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;that it should never be taken for granted. There are 351 Division I teams that aspire to that goal at the start of every season, and earning one of those sixty-eight invitations means something. That was especially true for our seniors, including one young man in particular, Jay- Vaughn Pinkston, or J.P. as we called him. I&#x2019;ll use JayVaughn as a way to examine something we value more than winning at Villanova: our players, and how they develop as people during their time with us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> JayVaughn Pinkston had come to Villanova as a McDonald&#x2019;s All- American from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, New York. At 6'7" and a rock-solid 240 pounds, his frame hearkens back to the tough power forwards of yesteryear. In fact, if you were constructing an ideal forward, you might start with the kind of chis- eled frame J.P. sports today.<br> Yet that physical snapshot is only part of who he is.<br><br> During his four years at Bishop Loughlin, JayVaughn wound up playing for four different head coaches, a fluke of timing and circum- stance. That&#x2019;s very tough on a player. There&#x2019;s no continuity. It&#x2019;s a new system to learn every year. After each of those coaching changes, there were Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams and other high schools urging him to switch programs. Each time he refused.<br><br> JayVaughn was a tough city kid, and you could see that on the court. Like a lot of city kids, I think, he was comfortable being a man of few words. What struck me was that even though he didn&#x2019;t come across as a gregarious individual, the people at Bishop Loughlin loved him. I think that had a lot to do with the loyalty he showed to his school and the people who cared about him.<br> As a freshman at Villanova, JayVaughn had his career sidetracked after an incident at an off-campus fraternity party in November 2010. He got into a fight with another student, and the mistake cost him dearly. The university deemed it a violation of student conduct and suspended him for the remainder of that school year.<br>JayVaughn could have left Villanova, and it was an option I pre- sented him with during a series of long discussions we held in the weeks after the incident. If he had wanted a fresh start somewhere else, we would have supported that. But he and his mom, Kerry, who had raised him by herself in the gritty Brownsville section of Brook- lyn, were determined to see him through this. They resolved that he wouldn&#x2019;t leave Villanova without a degree.<br><br> Rather than simply return to Brooklyn for six months of idle time, JayVaughn chose to remain in the area. (The terms of his suspension prevented him from living on campus.) To pay the bills, he found a job in a warehouse. He paid rent to a local family to live in their home. J.P. was on his own from a basketball standpoint, unable to work out with our team. We stayed in touch via text and phone calls, but we saw him infrequently, usually at our weekly radio show after he finished work. When the show ended at 8 p.m., we would some- times have dinner together. <br> For a guy who loves basketball the way J.P. does, it wasn&#x2019;t an easy time.<br><br> He was reinstated as a student in time to rejoin us for the first summer session in June 2011, but he was not in top basketball condi- tion. He had to spend extra time in our weight room, working under the supervision of our excellent strength and conditioning coach, John Shackleton. Every day he got a little bit better, but there was a long road ahead. Still a freshman in 2011&#x2013;2012, he moved into the starting lineup and, over the next few seasons, became one of the most respected players in the Big East.<br><br> J.P.&#x2019;s rise mirrored that of our team. As he became one of our top defenders, we became a better defensive team. Over time he learned how to lead, and as he did we became a more confident unit. By the time he became a senior he was our rock, never caring what his point total looked like, concerned only with the team&#x2019;s success.<br><br> That is why, as far as we&#x2019;re concerned, JayVaughn is a model of success for a Villanova Basketball player.<br><br> Coming in, he wasn&#x2019;t a great student, but he wanted to become one. He arrived as a highly skilled individual player who wanted to become part of something larger than himself. He faced some tough challenges and overcame them with dignity. In the end, he left Vil- lanova as a beloved figure with his degree in hand, and leadership traits he might have never known he possessed. He played a vital role on some of the best teams Villanova has ever had. In every way pos- sible, JayVaughn helped prepare our guys for their next journey&#x2014;the one that would end with us on top.<br> And in his own final college game, he played with focus, together with his teammates, to the very last second.</p><h2>Carmilla: A Pomegranate Vintage Vampire Edition</h2><p>"For a hundred and forty years Carmilla has given readers&#x2019; bodies and souls a shake, because the vampire is beautiful but repulsive, to be resisted at all costs, because the narrative alternates so imaginatively between twittering girlies and an urgent need to reach for sharpened wooden stakes. Is there any reason it won&#x2019;t continue to do so far into the future? Give it a read, and feel how it crawls under your skin." From the Foreword by Daniel Richler The goal of The House of Pomegranates Press is to produce arcane and magical little packages full of words that inform, disturb and most importantly, inspire. With Carmilla we begin our Vintage Vampire series. Over the next few years we intend to publish &#x2014; beautifully &#x2014; as many vintage vampire novels as we can. Why? Because since childhood we&#x2019;ve been haunted by these stories. As we grew, our complicated messy brains morphed these stories and characters from esoteric shadows under our beds into real, tangible, existentialist demons. They walked amongst us, they became our friends, our lovers, our fears. We felt it was time to gather those demons, wrap them in lovely covers and place them into a modern context with intelligent introductions by fascinating people. And so here you have Carmilla beautifully illustrated by Taeden Hall with a foreword by the quite wonderful, erudite Mr. Daniel Richler. Who better than he to blend vampires, Victoriana, politics, feminism and girl school lesbianism?

Is the evolution of life describable by any physics-like laws? Stuart Kauffman's latest book offers an explanation-beyond what the laws of physics can explain-of the progression from a complex chemical environment to molecular reproduction, metabolism and to early protocells, and further evolution to what we recognize as life. Among the estimated one hundred billion solar systems in the known universe, evolving life is surely abundant. That evolution is a process of "becoming" in each case. Since Newton, we have turned to physics to assess reality. But physics alone cannot tell us where we came from, how we arrived, and why our world has evolved past the point of unicellular organisms to an extremely complex biosphere.<br><br>Building on concepts from his work as a complex systems researcher at the Santa Fe Institute, Kauffman focuses in particular on the idea of cells constructing themselves and introduces concepts such as "constraint closure." Living systems are defined by the concept of "organization" which has not been focused on in enough in previous works. Cells are autopoetic systems that build themselves: they literally construct their own constraints on the release of energy into a few degrees of freedom that constitutes the very thermodynamic work by which they build their own self creating constraints. Living cells are "machines" that construct and assemble their own working parts. The emergence of such systems-the origin of life problem-was probably a spontaneous phase transition to self-reproduction in complex enough prebiotic systems. The resulting protocells were capable of Darwin's heritable variation, hence open-ended evolution by natural selection. Evolution propagates this burgeoning organization. Evolving living creatures, by existing, create new niches into which yet further new creatures can emerge. If life is abundant in the universe, this self-constructing, propagating, exploding diversity takes us beyond physics to biospheres everywhere.<br></p><p><br>Stuart Kauffman is a medical doctor, theoretical biologist, and complex systems researcher. He has held professorships at the University of Chicago and University of Pennsylvania and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in evolutionary biology in 1987.

(1)</h2><p>Are you concerned about your health and longevity, and the health of your children AND your children&#39;s children? Are you concerned about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, degenerative arthritis, autism, and the rest of the chronic diseases we hear about so frequently these days? If you are, this book is a must read! What you will find may completely change your view of the causes of these devastating diseases and give you hope for a future of good health and a productive life. Dr. Reed has written a riveting expos� of the many ways that our health has been stolen by the very people we&#39;ve entrusted to protect us. From toxic chemicals in every sector of our daily lives, to government and pharmaceutical industry corruption and coverup, to a medical profession that has lost its way, sanctioning sick care over health care, and violating some of the most fundamental principles of the healing arts -- we are sicker than ever before. If we fail to recognize what is at stake here and do not act to stop the madness, we are relinquishing control of our health and the health of our future generations to those who have already demonstrated an alarming neglect of their responsibility to do what is morally, medically, and ethically right. Our health HAS been hijacked, and it&#39;s high time to take it back! A blockbuster, a must-read, a stunning indictment of those that profit from our ill-health!</p><p>Dr. Tom Reed is a double board certified medical and surgical specialist.

How to create the perfect, healthy cup of tea is a process few people genuinely understand, making <i>The Ancient Art of Tea</i> a needed guide for tea lovers. <br><br>Making a perfect cup of tea is a dynamic process that requires the right environment, clear spring water, a suitable fire to boil water, skill in steeping tea, and deep understanding of tea connoisseurship.<br><br>From a variety of ancient tea books comes a broader perspective and deeper insight into the topics that surround the tea drinking experience. The ancient Chinese held tea and the various types of tea in high regard for its medicinal and rejuvenating properties. They prized the teas that grew high in the mountains, in crags and crevices in the rocks. They believed that tea was best brewed with pure, clean, mountain spring water, and that fire should be from clean and natural sources since properly heated water would define the subtle tastes of the tea. Using the proper utensils enhanced the taste and experience of tea drinking. And they believed that where you had your tea, along with the people with whom you shared the experience, all determine the value of the tea.<br><br><i>The Ancient Art of Tea</i> contains vital information to assist tea drinkers in their quest for yet another pot of delicious tea. This book teaches the two fundamental secrets to tea as practiced in ancient China&#x2014;technique and taste. These exemplify some of the basic concepts of the philosophy of tea, which greatly enhances tea enjoyment. Not only an exhaustive source of tea knowledge, <i>The Ancient Art of Tea</i> is also a significant volume in the study of Chinese tea and is sure to become a classic in itself.</p><p><b>Warren Peltier</b> is the Director of the Chuan Ming Chadao Tea Culture Research Center and well-known tea expert.

It is time for us to pick up the mantle and spread the word, Tea." &#x2014;<b>Dr. Eric Messersmith, Institute for Asian Studies, Florida International University</b><br><br>"This is not a practical book about how to prepare tea in modern times, but a book about the development of tea culture. The book is aimed at people who love tea.

This lively exploration of Jewish ideas and beliefs provides a rationale and stimulus for anyone seeking to understand or reconnect to the rich and diverse spiritual tradition of Judaism.</p><p><i>What Do Jews Believe?: The Spiritual Foundations of Judaism</i>, by David Ariel, is a basic exploration of the broad question posed by its title. Ariel's contention is that "Judaism is not a religion of fixed doctrines or dogmas but a complex system of evolving beliefs." And yet despite its diversity, "no matter how literally or metaphorically we choose to interpret them, ... sacred myths form the framework for the Jew's ongoing search for personal meaning in his or her own life, the life of the Jewish community, and society at large." <i>What Do Jews Believe?</i> describes some essential "sacred myths," such as the existence and nature of God, the meaning of the Torah, the importance of prayer, and the significance of chosenness. Ariel's selection and exploration of these myths is guided by the following questions: Which Jewish beliefs have survived from antiquity to the present day, how have they evolved over time, and what beliefs distinguish Judaism today? As he pursues these questions, Ariel enthusiastically describes Judaism's seminal influence on the rise of humanism, which makes his book especially credible for readers whose sympathies are more secular than his own. <p> Perhaps the best part of this book is its conclusion, a <i>tzavaah</i>, or ethical will, written as an open letter to his children. In it, he quotes a letter from a mother to her child, written while they were living in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940, before they both were murdered by the Nazis. This letter offers an extraordinarily persuasive and poignant summary of what exactly makes a Jew a Jew: "Judaism, my child, is the struggle to bring down God upon earth, a struggle for the sanctification of the human heart. This struggle your people wages not with physical force but with spirit and by constant striving for truth and justice. So, do you understand, my child, how we are distinct from others and wherein lies the secret of our existence on earth?" To these words, Ariel adds a moving piece of advice to his own children, and to his readers: "Remember, your life is like a book. Write in it what you want to be known about you." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>Once understood as an inherited tradition, religion is increasingly viewed today as a matter of personal choice, an experience to be examined and explored. Yet while many American Jews feel an emotional attachment to Judaism, they cannot always articulate the beliefs that define their faith. In this provocative study, David Ariel explores the diverse and colorful views of Jewish thinkers on the profound issues of God, human destiny, good and evil, chosenness, Torah, and messianism, among many other subjects. Despite a diversity of views, Ariel finds an overarching structure in the &#34;sacred myths&#34; that Jews of every orientation return to as their core beliefs - the essential ideas that each generation strives to interpret and apply to life. To call these beliefs &#34;myths&#34; does not mean that they are fairy tales, but rather that they are starting points that define the essence of faith. Meaning, Ariel argues, is always presented in the language of the myths, or beliefs, that a culture holds sacred, and the sacred myths of Judaism reveal the special nature of Jewish spirituality. This spirited, clarifying discussion guides us toward a definition of the beliefs that shape Jewish identity, providing the rationale and stimulus for a reconnection to the spiritual tradition of Judaism.</p><h2>Cain</h2><p>&#x201c;Saramago juxtaposes an eminently readable narrative of work and poverty, class and desire, knowledge and timelessness&#x2014;one in which God, too, as he faces Cain in the wake of Noah's Ark, emerges as far more human than expected.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>In this, his last novel, Jos� Saramago daringly reimagines the characters and narratives of the Old Testament, recalling his provocative <i>The Gospel According to Jesus Christ</i>. His tale runs from the Garden of Eden, when God realizes he has forgotten to give Adam and Eve the gift of speech, to the moment when Noah&#x2019;s Ark lands on the dry peak of Ararat. Cain, the despised, the murderer, is Saramago&#x2019;s protagonist.<br><br>Condemned to wander forever after he kills his brother Abel, Cain makes his way through the world in the company of a personable donkey. He is a witness to and participant in the stories of Isaac and Abraham, the destruction of the Tower of Babel, Moses and the golden calf, the trials of Job. The rapacious Queen Lilith takes him as her lover. An old man with two sheep on a rope crosses his path. And again and again, Cain encounters a God whose actions seem callous, cruel, and unjust. He confronts Him, he argues with Him. &#x201c;And one thing we know for certain,&#x201d; Saramago writes, &#x201c;is that they continued to argue and are arguing still.&#x201d;<br><br>A startling book&#x2014;sensual, funny&#x2014;and in all ways a fitting end to Saramago&#x2019;s extraordinary career.<br><br>&#x201c;A winkingly blasphemous retelling of the Old Testament . . . Saramago, playfully stretching his chatty late style, pokes holes in the stated logic of the Biblical God throughout the novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In his final slim novel, the late Jos� Saramago gives a cheeky modernist update to a timeworn biblical tale. After killing his brother Abel in an exasperated rage, Cain makes a deal with a CEO-like God and escapes with little more than a donkey and a few snacks, doomed to nomadic immortality. As he wanders through time and space, the handsome itinerant interferes with the dealings of a familiar cast of characters--Noah, Moses, Isaac--forever altering the course of legend along the way. Deeply flawed and all too human, despite the eternal life granted him, Cain also struggles openly with the idea of faith in the face of an equally flawed God. By turns philosophical and hilarious, <em>Cain</em> shows off the scope of Saramago&#x2019;s talent and makes a fitting coda for a superlative writing life. <em>--Mia Lipman</em>HMH Hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN: 978-0-547-48334-4</p><h2>Stone Fox</h2><p><p><strong>John Reynolds Gardiner's classic action-packed adventure story about a thrilling dogsled race has captivated readers for more than thirty years.</strong></p><p>Based on a Rocky Mountain legend, <em>Stone Fox</em> tells the story of Little Willy, who lives with his grandfather in Wyoming.

From his sickly childhood to charging up San Juan Hill to waving his fist under J.P. Morgan's rubicund nose, <em>Theodore Roosevelt</em> offers the intimate history of a man who continues to cast a magic spell over the American imagination.</p><p>As the twenty-sixth president of the United States, from 1901 to 1909, Roosevelt embodied the overwheliming confidence of the nation as it entered the American Century. With fierce joy, he brandished a "Big Stick" abroad and promised a "Square Deal" at home. He was the nation's first environmental president, challenged the trusts, and, as the first American leader to play an important role in world affairs, began construction of a long-dreamed canal across Panama and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for almost singlehandedly bringing about a peaceful end to the Russo-Japanese War.</p><p>In addition to following Roosevelt's political career, <em>Theodore Roosevelt</em> looks deeply into his personal relations to draw a three-dimensional portrait of a man who confronted life-wrenching tragedies as well as triumphs. It is biography at its most compelling.</p></p><p><p>Nathan Miller, a four-time nominee for the Pulitzer Prize, is the author of <em>FDR: An Intimate History, The Roosevelt Chronicles, </em> and<em> The U.S. Navy</em>.</p>Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was the first president to make the federal goverment rectify harsh social and economic conditions. It was during his administration (1901-1909) that the U.S. was transformed from a provincial nation on the fringes of global affairs into a world power. Those are key contentions of this first-rate biography, in which Miller ( FDR: An Intimate History ) covers the political accomplishments and personal facets of this prismatic figure--politician, statesman, soldier, conservationist, historian, biographer, adventurer. What distinguishes this biography from others is its concentration on TR's relations with his close associates and his family, particularly his first and second wives (Miller is the first biographer to make extensive use of Roosevelt's courtship letters). Here is Teddy Roosevelt in three dimensions: ardent, inexhaustibly vital and astonishingly versatile. Photos.

As far back as the eighth century B.C., sailors in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> stuffed wax in their ears to resist the Sirens, who lured men to their watery deaths with song. More than two thousand years later, the gullible New York public lined up to witness a mummified "mermaid" specimen that the enterprising showman P. T. Barnum swore was real. <br><br><i>The Penguin Book of Mermaids</i> is a treasury of such tales about merfolk and water spirits from different cultures, ranging from Scottish selkies to Hindu water-serpents to Chilean sea fairies. A third of the selections are published here in English for the first time, and all are accompanied by commentary that explores their undercurrents, showing us how public perceptions of this popular mythical hybrid--at once a human and a fish--illuminate issues of gender, spirituality, ecology, and sexuality.</p><p><b>Cristina Bacchilega</b> is a professor and the graduate program director in the Department of English at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.

People who accept that they are largely in control of their lives tend to do better than those who feel that fate or external factors rule what they do, especially in novel and difficult situations.This book explains LOC research, until now mainly confined to academic circles, in terms easily understandable to the average person. The author, a clinical psychologist who has spent nearly five decades investigating and writing about LOC, helps the reader to explore his or her own locus of control and what those orientations might mean for how life is lived. He discusses the extensively documented relationship between LOC and academic achievement, personal and social adjustment, health, and financial success.Dr. Nowicki notes that there has been an increasing tendency among Americans to feel as though their lives are slipping out of their control, and he identifies ways to reverse this negative trend.He describes how the Locus of Control is learned and demonstrates ways in which it can be changed to yield higher levels of achievement, success, personal satisfaction, and better interactions with others.</p><p><b>Stephen Nowicki </b>is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Emory University in Atlanta.

Capitalizing on a massive and impressive body of research, this pioneering psychologist highlights the value of an internal, rather than external, locus of control, which gives people the strength, energy, and determination to successfully cope with life&#x2019;s challenges and enjoy life&#x2019;s opportunities. This fun book offers invaluable, creative, diverse, and appealing suggestions for modifying your own locus of control and improving the quality of your life.

There are fifty-six authors featured in this volume; authors such as: John Bunyan, Jonathan Edwards, John Gill, William Gouge, Matthew Henry, Martin Luther, A.W. Pink, J. C. Ryle, R. C. Sproul, Charles Spurgeon and Thomas Watson. Each of them give a powerful testimony that the twenty-first-century church needs to be reminded of what she used to believe about family life. These authors bring a measure of the correction and the balm necessary to heal our amnesia and return us to biblical order.</p> <p>In the mid 1990s, it began to occur to me that the modern Church had actually lost the biblical doctrine of the family. Biblical fatherhood was dead. Feminists owned womanhood. Motherhood was despised. Babies were marginalized as thieves of convenience and success. In America, we have aborted millions of children since 1973. Marriages were crumbling, and the very institution was being redefined. It was almost impossible to find men in the church who understood biblical manhood or fatherhood. The twentieth century was a bad time for the family; the trends were all running in the wrong direction, and biblical ignorance was speeding the family on its way to destruction.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jeff Pollard was doing something about it. He was toiling into the night to document a correct theology of the family. He brought these doctrines together in an organized form for the ministry of Chapel Library. If you have known Jeff for any length of time, you know that the last twelve years of his life has been defined by his ministry to Mount Zion Bible Church and the unrelenting schedule to produce the Free Grace Broadcaster, a quarterly digest of Christ-centered sermons and articles from prior centuries. It is all about recovering sound doctrine and biblical practices. Jeff has produced dozens of booklets on subjects such as the gospel, sin, repentance, the Holy Spirit, the blood of Christ, justification, sanctification, secret sins, and many other critical matters. Through Jeff s work at Chapel Library, there is a wealth of doctrinal resources that are being shipped all over the world. He brought them together in order to correct the lapses, heal the wounds, and pass them on to the rising generation. He worked for over a decade to identify the great authors and writings of the past that could meet the problems of our day. He went back in time. He returned to eras where a Christ centered view of the family was understood much better. He has revealed the doctrine locked in the literary treasure chests of the past. I am thankful that he also did this for the doctrine of the family.</p></p><p><p>Scott T.

Through Maloof&#x2019;s engaging, conversational style, each essay offers a lesson in stewardship as it explores the interwoven connections between a tree species and the animals and insects whose lives depend on it&#x2015;and who, in turn, work to ensure the tree&#x2019;s survival.</p><p>Never really at home in a laboratory, Maloof took to the woods early in her career. Her enthusiasm for firsthand observation in the wild spills over into her writing, whether the subject is the composition of forest air, the eagle&#x2019;s preference for nesting in loblolly pines, the growth rings of the bald cypress, or the gray squirrel&#x2019;s fondness for weevil-infested acorns. With a storyteller&#x2019;s instinct for intriguing particulars, Maloof expands our notions about what a tree &#x201c;is&#x201d; through her many asides&#x2015;about the six species of leafhoppers who eat only sycamore leaves or the midges who live inside holly berries and somehow prevent them from turning red.</p><p>As a scientist, Maloof accepts that trees have a spiritual dimension that cannot be quantified. As an unrepentant tree hugger, she finds support in the scientific case for biodiversity. As an activist, she can&#x2019;t help but wonder how much time is left for our forests.</p></p><p>JOAN MALOOF is a professor emeritus of biology and environmental studies at Salisbury University.<p>Walk along with Joan Maloof through a forest, and you will see, hear, and smell stories better than anything on the Discovery Channel or, for that matter, in the Brothers Grimm.

More than a study of history, however, <i>The Myth of the Blood</i> is a magisterial overview of the problem of human race itself, by one of the great thinkers of the past century, the traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola.</p> <p>This book traces the development of the concept of race from antiquity to contemporary times, proceeding through historical, mythical, scientific, and philosophical perspectives, keenly dissecting the thought of the foremost theoreticians in the field of race studies.

Born in Rome, Evola began his pursuit of truth as a Dadaist painter and an Idealist philosopher, but quickly lost his taste for modernism and moved on to metaphysics, religion, and the occult. Encountering the work of Ren� Gu�non, who became a lifelong friend, Evola embraced his concept of the Primordial Tradition and his critique of the modern world. Believing that Tradition was an idea which should encompass the social as well as the spiritual world, Evola saw some hope for a remedy to the ills of modernity in Italian Fascism, although he never joined the Party, and his writings on the subject were frequently critical of its reality. After 1945, Evola remained aloof from politics, and attempted to define the most effective stance for an inhabitant of the modern age to adopt while still retaining something of traditional wisdom. In recent years, Evola&#39;s ideas have given rise to a new breed of spiritual seekers and anti-modernists.</p><h2>Hidden Worlds: Looking Through a Scientist&#39;s Microscope (Scientists in the Field Series)</h2><p>There are hidden worlds in nature&#x2014;places you can visit only with a microscope.

Kunkel works with microscopes to explore science, both on his own and with specialists from related fields. This book contains many of his photos, most taken with electron microscopes. It's fascinating to see the magnified pictures of jellyfish, dust mites, and other creatures, neatly tinted to accentuate body features. Several opening pages, along with the front and back endpapers, are visually dazzling. The heart of the book, though, is what readers learn about how Kunkel produces these images, and to what uses scientists put them. The story of how he worked within the blast zone of Mount St. Helens in 1980 in order to study the effect of volcanic ash on algae is a vivid example of how exciting science can be. The text describes the qualities of several different microscopes, and photographs show the scientist using each tool in his lab. Readers also see samples of the images from each instrument, from the simple view captured with a loupe lens to the neurological details revealed by a transmission electron microscope. Like Kramer's Eye of the Storm (Putnam, 1997), this title offers a wealth of scientific information along with an insightful look at the world of an individual scientist.<p></p><p><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, </i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Wild Birds: Six Stories of the Port William Membership</h2><p><b>"Berry is a superb writer. His sense of what makes characters tick is extraordinary . . . Short stories don't get any better than these." &#x2015;<i>People</i></b><br><br> As part of Counterpoint's celebration of beloved American author Wendell Berry comes this reissue of his 1986 classic, <i>The Wild Birds: Six Stories of the Port William Membership</i>. Those stories include "Thicker Than Liquor", "Where Did They Go?", "It Wasn't Me", "The Boundary", "That Distant Land", and the titular "The Wild Birds."<br><br> Spanning more than three decades, from 1930 to 1967, these wonderful stories follow Wheeler Catlett, and reintroduce readers to the beloved people who live in Berry's fictional town of Port William, Kentucky.</p><p><b>WENDELL BERRY</b>, an essayist, novelist, and poet. In 2010, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama, and in 2016, he was the recipient of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Book Critics Circle. Berry lives with his wife, Tanya Berry, on their farm in Henry County, Kentucky.<b>Praise for <i>The Wild Birds</i></b><br><br> "Berry is a poet of landscapes and legacies: <i>The Wild Birds</i> is a heartfelt exploration of the complex bonds between generations and the ways in which a neighborhood is shaped by its common ties to the land and undone when those connections weaken." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"Berry is a superb writer. His sense of what makes characters tick is extraordinary. His farmers love their land in a powerful bond that moves them forward, generation after generation, with a sense of fulfillments that seems unique in this day of disaffected heroes and writers who turn to black humor when they must deal with eternal verities . . . Short stories don't get any better than these." &#x2015;<i>People</i><br><br> "<i>The Wild Birds</i> is one of those books that remind one of the real purpose and possibilities of the literary art. The good and simple truth to which each of Berry's stories testifies is that its author observes people carefully, understands them precisely, and cares about them deeply; bombast, pretension, and narcissism are alien to him . . . One has the refreshing impression that Berry doesn't give a damn what's in and what's out; he writes what he wants to write." &#x2015;<i>The New Criterion</i><br><br> "Readers would have to look long and hard to find a more polished and engaging collection of stories. Wendell Berry once again has proven himself an original American prose voice." &#x2015;<i>San Diego Magazine</i><br><br> "In these stories, Berry traces the history of a loosely affiliated, unofficial, fictional group of dead and living men and women, 'the membership of the fields' in Port William, a community in Kentucky's tobacco country . . . Told with the same intelligence, craft, and reverence that characterize Berry's novels, essays on agriculture, and poems, these stories have at their core the necessity of human friendship, 'the good that has been possible in the world . . . the good that is desirable in it.' Highly recommended." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "This collection of six interrelated stories, set in the 1930s through the '70s, portrays life in backcountry Kentucky and its county seat, 'a dying town in the midst of a wasting country.' Wheeler Catlett, the central, unifying figure, is a lawyer whose roots and sensibilities exfoliate from the soil of the surrounding farmland. He is its voice and consciousness, its collective memory; his 'clients,' who are also his friends, neighbors and kinfolk, provide his cast of characters." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Fidelity</i></b><br><br> "Berry richly evokes Port William's farmlands and hamlets, and his characters are fiercely individual, yet mutually protective in everything they do. . . . His sentences are exquisitely constructed, suggesting the cyclic rhythms of his agrarian world." &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Each of these elegant stories spans the twentieth century and reveals the profound interconnectedness of the farmers and their families to one another, to their past and to the landscape they inhabit." &#x2015;<i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> "Visionary . . . rooted in a deep concern for nature and the land, . . . [these stories are] tough, relentless and clear. In a roundabout way they are confrontational because they ask basic questions about men and women, violence, work and loyalty." &#x2015;Hans Ostrom, <i>The Morning News Tribune</i><br><br> "The rarest (and highest) of literary classes consists of that small group of authors who are absolutely inimitable. . . . One of the half-dozen living American authors who belong in this class is Wendell Berry. . . . [this] whole book is vintage Berry." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> "Birth, life, death and the primary institutions of family and community are the axes on which the stories turn. Their plots are as slender as fence posts: a soldier walks home at war's end; a young woman with a mild fever ponders her first years of marriage; a taciturn farmer takes his moribund father out of a hospital's intensive care unit so the old man can die with dignity. But Berry invests them with intense feeling, using the plain language of a largely oral culture, building metaphors and similes that have the clear ring of folk wisdom. His ground's-eye view of events can be chilling, as when he sums up World War II as a great tearing apart. If the stories seem somber in their emphasis on loss, the pains are clearly leavened by the comforts of community and connectedness that a small town can provide. An excellent introduction to one of America's finest prose writers." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "In these five interrelated stories, Berry focuses once again on the fictional town of Port William and on characters like Andrew Catlett, the central figure of his novel The Remembering. Each story dramatizes an individual crisis but also emphasizes an abiding sense of community and the simple but solid agrarian values that sustain it. Berry's tales . . . are engaging and display a quiet but powerful dignity." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "Berry has employed all the forms he works in&#x2015;poetry, the essay, fiction short and long&#x2015;toward an examination of what it means to be placed: what here and elsewhere he calls 'membership'; American individualism-turned-loneliness seems like the nightmare that puts his eloquence to greatest use . . . Ultimately, the prose of the stories less illustrates the Port William values&#x2015;forgiveness, dignity, fidelity, community&#x2015;than provides an indelible, surefooted rhythm for them. Cadenced, eternal-seeming sentences plank everything; there is an enchantment to them . . . Uncommonly satisfying art and vision." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Watch With Me</i></b><br><br> "Wendell Berry writes with a good husbandman's care and economy . . . His stories are filled with gentle humor." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Berry is the master of earthy county living seen through the eyes of laconic farmers . . . He makes his stories shine with meaning and warmth." &#x2015;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br> "A small treasure of a book . . . part of a long line that descends from Chaucer to Katherine Mansfield to William Trevor." &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br> "With the simplicity of folk tales, these stories beautifully evoke a world where people live in relatively harmony with nature, the land and community, and where neighborliness and human scale still matter." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "This charming collection examines the lives of Tol and Miss Minnie on their Kentucky farm from 1908 to 1941. Despite its universal appeal, this book is distinctly Southern, rich with delightful colloquialisms and the mores and attitudes of rural folk of that time. Some stories are framed . . . underscor[ing] the fact that storytelling and the past are integral to Southern society . . . Every reader deserves the opportunity to meet Tol and Miss Minnie." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "These seven stories relate incidents in the life of a very good man, Ptolemy&#x2015;'Tol'&#x2015;Proudfoot, towering final scion of a line of Kentucky farmers loved for their gentleness, intelligence, and gregariousness and their sense of and love for their place and work in the world . . . Their diction is as chaste as a Bible story's; they express a biblical reverence for life and community, yet they're funny, too, and so beautiful." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "The local nature of their canny, comic tonalities, the old-timey subtitle, and the fact that all the action takes place before 1942 might lead browsers to take these Berry stories as merely quaint. That would be a mistake. In fact, like Isaac Bashevis Singer, Berry has been expanding by contraction, husbanding by close focus&#x2015;in Berry's case, on the familiar demesne of Port William, Ky . . . The long title story, which closes the collection, is a masterpiece . . . The tale clarifies Berry's direction, as he moves way beyond nostalgia toward an immersion in other lives that expresses itself as a sense of intimate apartness&#x2015;a willingness to follow his characters, but not necessarily to change them. Poetry nestled inside prose: startlingly and classically moving." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Nathan Coulter</i></b><br><br> "An assured depiction of the coming of age of a young man in rural America . . . By any standards an unusual and rewarding writer, Berry is especially recommended to readers struggling with the moral and ethical questions confronting contemporary Americans." &#x2015;<i>Newsday</i><br><br> "Spare, elegant and eloquent . . . [<i>Nathan Coulter</i>] is an absolute jewel." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> "The Coulter family, like the rest of the people who dwell in this tiny farming community . . . are caught on the wheel of nature, which is at once blindingly beautiful and unwittingly cruel . . . The narrative is stunning, the natural scene is beautifully evoked." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> "Berry's prose, so carefully tuned you never know it is there, carries us into the very heart of Nathan Coulter and into the land itself." &#x2015;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>A Place on Earth</i></b><br><br> "The revised version of <i>A Place on Earth</i> is a masterpiece &#x2013; the best thing Wendell Berry has done, a book not to be missed." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "This is not a book to read at a sitting. It needs to be savored. Written by a craftsman poet, every word is chosen with great care. Many of Berry's poems reveal the same fascination with the rhythms and cycles of rural living as <i>A Place on Earth</i>, just as his essays reflect his integrity and common sense." &#x2015;<i>Newsday</i><br><br> "Granted, when measured by the yardstick of the contemporary fiction marketplace, <i>A Place on Earth</i> can certainly be described as demanding, but the excellent production offers a feast of the senses for discerning audiences." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>The Memory of Old Jack</i></b><br><br> "Few novelists treat both their characters and their readers with the kind of respect that Wendell Berry displays in this deeply moving account . . . <i>The Memory of Old Jack</i> is a slab of rich Americana." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Remembering</i></b><br><br> "In <i>Remembering</i>, Wendell Berry has constructed an almost perfect fiction, a sublime meditation on how irrevocable loss is redeemed through a renewed sense of kinship with the land and the past . . . A beautiful and ennobling book." &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i><br><br> "Berry writes with grace and eloquence of the beauty in handed-down lives." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "[Andy's] journey from spiritual darkness to light, from wounded alienation to healed community, conveyed by Berry's exact and sensitive prose, constitutes an epic poem of American agriculture as much as a short novel. In it, Berry weds more happily than ever before his skills as one of our finest, keenest-eyed, sharpest-eared poets to his moral concerns as our preeminent philosopher of agriculture." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "This short, intensely lyrical novel celebrates 'the hope and dream of membership' in a community of friends and relations, all of whom share in each other's past and in their respect for nature... [<i>Remembering</i>] ends as pure poetry." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>A World Lost</i></b><br><br> "Brilliantly detailed characters and subtle social observations distinguish Berry's unassuming but powerful fifth novel . . . Imbued with the textures, dialect and social mores of backwater Kentucky during WWII, the narrative is pulled along by a chain of revelations about the interior lives of the characters. Berry shows us the psychic costs of misplaced family pride and social rigidity, and yet he also celebrates the benevolent blessing of familial love. This is simple, soul-satisfying storytelling, augmented by understated humor and quiet insight." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "This time the poet/essayist/novelist turns his attention to nine-year-old Andy Catlett, whose world is turned upside down in 1944, when his beloved Uncle Andrew is murdered. Still haunted by the event years later, Andy researches the seldom-discussed details in an effort to understand Uncle Andrew's fate. In doing so, he learns a great deal about his uncle, his family, his neighbors, and life in the late 1940s. This gentle tale deals with big issues: grief, love, truth, and loss, and their effects on a young mind trying to grow." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "Like <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Berry's fifth novel is concerned with an extraordinary man's murder. Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway rehearses and combs the events that led to the killing, but Berry's Andy Catlett concentrates on the tragedy's effects on those who knew and loved the victim, especially his family . . . Andy concludes with the greatest thing he learned: suddenly or gradually, the momentary material world and its people, no matter how cherished, pass away, yet we remain 'in the company of the immortals with whom [we] have lived here day by day.' Writing with his customary limpid grace, Berry transforms an elegy into a hope-filled hymn." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "By the prolific poet, novelist, and social critic an elegiac celebration of the end of innocence . . . Berry deftly balances Andy's investigation into the town's past with an equally moving portrait of his growing realization not only of the sustaining value of memory but of the manner in which people are shaped in enduring ways by what they love. This is a modest, resonant work, both a sharp portrait of a small farming town nursing its secrets over several decades, and a penetrating celebration of the hold of family on the imagination." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Jayber Crow</i></b><br><br> "The role of community in the shaping of character is a recurring theme in the work of poet, essayist and novelist Berry, as evidenced once more in this gratifying novel set in Berry's fictional Port William, Ky . . . Berry's narrative style is deliberately traditional, and the novel's pace is measured and leisurely . . . It is to Berry's credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Hannah Coulter</i></b><br><br> "Berry renders abstractions like community and home as breathing organisms. . . . Berry's stories are meant to welcome, to be retold, repeated and handed down to cement the bonds between generations and among neighbors . . . It's a rare novel that can make one yearn so comprehensively for self-improvement." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> "<i>Hannah Coulter</i> is set in the latter half of the past century, but like the best contemporary fiction, it is informed by our present moment." &#x2015;<i>Seattle Times</i><br><br> "[F]ew write American English more limpidly than Berry, and he has realized his characters as thoroughly as Faulkner did any of the people of Yoknapatawpha County. But as this telling of a farm woman's life in her voice continues&#x2015;and voice it seems more than writing, so spontaneously speechlike are its cadences and the simple accuracy of its diction&#x2015;it feels ever more poetic . . .

It is splendid and impressive to have at last a clear, unobstructed view of her ground-breaking poetry&#x2015;the work of a poet who, as Kenneth Rexroth put it, "more than anyone, led the redirection of American poetry...to the mainstream of world literature."<br><br> Described by <em>Publishers Weekly</em> as "at once as intimate as Creeley and as visionary as Duncan," Levertov was lauded as "one of the indispensable poets of our language, one of those few writers to whom it is necessary to pay attention" by <em>The Malahat Review</em>. No poet is more overdue for a single accessible volume; no career could be better to have within easy reach.</p><p><strong>Denise Levertov</strong> (1923-1997) was a British born American poet. She wrote and published 20 books of poetry, criticism, translations. She also edited several anthologies. Among her many awards and honors, she received the Shelley Memorial Award, the Robert Frost Medal, the Lenore Marshall Prize, the Lannan Award, a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.&#34;In every time there are just a few poets whose work for its sheer lyric conscience--carries poetry safely into the future. Denise Levertov, as this book shows, is one of them.&#34;</p><h2>Old Soul Love</h2><p><b>An Instagram poet with hundreds of thousands of followers, Christopher Poindexter presents a new poetry collection themed on love in its many forms.</b><br><br><i>OLD SOUL LOVE</i> is a combination of new, never-before-seen poetry, mixed in with some of Christopher&#x2019;s most popular Instagram pieces, all of which explore the many shapes and forms of love. Unrequited love. Platonic love. Lost love. Self-love. And, for a lucky few humans: old soul love that seems to transcend even death.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Poindexter is a bohemian poet who began writing poetry on a rebellious trip to California when he was 18. He considers himself more of an observer, trying to make sense of the human condition in all of its grit and glory. Being very inspired by both the darkness and the light, he aims to share an ultimate truth in all of his writing; though we all have our dances with demons, our hearts haunted by loss, by fear, it is the light that always beckons us. Calls out our name in even the darkest hours. This is why we must love one another. Because we are not alone in this.</p><h2>Ashley Bryan&#39;s ABC of African American Poetry</h2><p><b><i>"And God stepped out on space, <br> And he looked around and said:<br> I'm lonely -- I'll make me a world."</i></b> <br> -- James Weldon Johnson <br> Thus begins Coretta Scott King Award-winner Ashley Bryan's collection of inspiring excerpts of poems by celebrated African American poets. Beautifully illustrated with his own tempera and gouache paintings, Ashley Bryan's unique alphabet book will delight readers of any age.</p><p><i>Ashley Bryan's ABC of African American Poetry</i> is not an alphabet book. Award-winning children's book author and former teacher Ashley Bryan has simply hit upon a straightforward way to present the work of his favorite African American poets: he uses a letter of each poem to organize the 25 excerpts and one African American spiritual. His vibrant artwork, with bold strokes of paint reminiscent of Vincent van Gogh, successfully captures the essence of each piece. "As I read," Bryan writes, "images sprang from the lines of the poets... Finally, I chose the sketches that offered a balanced play of images and did finished paintings from them in tempera paints and gouache colors." <p> Poems ranging from the intense to the whimsical reflect the diverse voices of poets such as Rita Dove, Lucille Clifton, and Gwendolyn Brooks. A colorful elephant stands solidly next to Countee Cullen's poem: "Dear Noah: Please save me a spot / Exposed to the sun, where the Mice are <i>not</i>; / But if I <i>must</i> share my chamber, the Ant / Is the one I should welcome. Yours: L. E. Phant." From Langston Hughes we hear, "There are words like Freedom / Sweet and wonderful to say. / On my heart-strings freedom sings / All day everyday." And Eloise Greenfield chimes in with "Harriet Tubman didn't take no stuff / Wasn't scared of nothing neither / Didn't come in this world to be no slave / And wasn't going to stay one neither." This innovative, easy-to-absorb, boldly illustrated introduction to a rich variety of African American poets would be a valuable addition to any child's bookshelf. <i>(All ages)</i></p>Thus begins Coretta Scott King Award-winner Ashley Bryan&#39;s collection of inspiring excerpts of poems by celebrated African American poets.

But once he began working, he found it impossible to tell the two apart. While helping poor patients from the South and West sides of Chicago, he realized individual therapy could not take into account the importance unemployment, poverty, lack of affordable housing and other policy decisions that impact the well-beings of both individuals and communities. It is easy to be depressed if you live in a neighborhood that has few supportive resources available, or is marred by gun violence. We are able to diagnose people with depression, but how does one heal a neighborhood? <i>This City Is Killing Me: Community Trauma and Toxic Stress in Urban America</i>, brings policy and psychology together. Through a remarkable set of case studies, Foiles opens up his therapy door to allow us to overhear the stories of Jacqueline, Frida, Robert, Luis, Anthony, and other poor Chicagoans. As we listen, Foiles teaches us how he diagnoses, explains how therapists before him would analyze these patients, and, through statistics and the example of Chicago, teaches us how policy decisions have contributed to these individuals&#x2019; suffering. The result is a remarkable, unique work with an urgent political call to action at its core.</p><p><b>Jonathan Foiles</b>, LSCW, is a therapist at an urban community mental health clinic in Chicago.

He lectures frequently to mental health professionals and to the general public.<b>Prologue: A Personal Perspective</b><br><br>I suffered obsessive -compulsive disorder myself while in medical training. Terrifying, tormenting thoughts often popped unbidden into my mind, causing surges of panic and piercing discomforts. The thoughts usually took the form of vibrant, violent images, for instance, of a knife being thrust into my flesh, or of my nose being scraped right off in a car accident. A particularly frequent one was that of my hand being punctured by a phlebotomy needle. I would have the sudden, intrusive image of me standing at a patient's bedside ready to draw a sample of blood: I unsheath a large-bore phlebotomy needle, menacing, daggerlike in its appearance, and then inexplicably, instead of inserting the needle into my patient's vein, I thrust it to the hilt into the thenar eminence of my hand. Upon the occurrence of this frightful fantasy, my hand would ache in a manner that seemed indistinguishable from genuine pain. I would shake it to make it feel better.<br><br>It was fortunate that these troublesome intruders into my consciousness rarely struck when I was engaged in important activities and that therefore they did not upset my medical career because they were impossible to fend off. The more I resisted them, the worse they became. I often used counter-ideas, or restorative images, to neutralize them. To counteract the phlebotomy-needle thought, I would imagine an impenetrable cream covering my hand. The needle would strike and promptly burst into pieces. The image would fade. Yet the tormenting fantasy would always return at another time.<br><br>What I suffered, I learned later, was a typical form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. My tormenting thoughts were obsessions, and my counteractive ideas were compulsions. I know now that by fearing them and fighting them, I only made them worse. But back then I didn't know any better.<br><br>What did I do for help? Since I later went on to study psychiatry, you'd think that I might have gotten therapy: probed into my unconscious, teased apart my ego defenses, scrutinized my childhood--at the very least, come to some sort of an understanding of my problem. Nothing of the sort. When my obsessions were not bothering me, I didn't want to think about them. I kept my tormenting thoughts a secret, as most OCDers do. Given the treatments that were available back then, it was probably just as well.<br><br>In the early I970S, mental health professionals knew next to nothing about obsessive-compulsive disorder. The field had come no further than had the great psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, who candidly admitted that OCD baffled him. His own theories on the subject, Freud once said, were no more than "doubtful assumptions and unconfirmed suppositions."<br><br>When I was in training, the psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and counselors who treated OCD sufferers had trouble just identifying obsessions when they saw them. The self-tormenting thoughts were considered rare, and as a result they were rarely recognized. Severe cases were routinely misdiagnosed as hallucinations; mild ones were written off as examples of obscure unconscious conflicts.<br><br>On those occasions when OCD was correctly diagnosed, treatment was next to worthless. They tried years of psychoanalysis, counseling, and group therapy; they prescribed antidepressant medications, antipsychotic medications, even shock therapy; but therapists themselves believed that OCD was a dark and mysterious illness, essentially incurable. That's what I was taught in medical school. If a patient had severe OCD, my professors would just shake their heads, intimating, "We'll do our best, but don't expect much." One clinician of that era wrote, "Most of us are agreed that the treatment of obsessional states is one of the most difficult tasks confronting the psychiatrist, and many of us consider it hopeless."<br><br>The good news is that times have changed.<br><br>The study of OCD has undergone a truly remarkable shift in emphasis, as researchers have turned away from unproven theories and jumped with both feet into the research lab. As a result of this dramatic change, our understanding of OCD has leaped forward. At a recent meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, more special reports were presented on OCD than on any other topic. OCD has been referred to as the "hot topic" of the I99OS, and professional journals are overflowing with updates on the chemistry, genetics, psychology, and treatment of obsessions and compulsions. The great news for OCD sufferers is that obsessive-compulsive disorder is now recognized as a common, physical disease for which effective treatment is available.<br><br><b>OCD: The Hidden Epidemic</b><br><br>When I was in training, psychiatrists estimated the incidence of a given mental disorder in the general population by extrapolating from the number of people known to be in treatment. Since back then only a tiny number of patients were diagnosed as having obsessive-compulsive disorder, OCD was thought to be very rare. The figure most commonly quoted for its overall incidence was a minuscule .05 percent.<br><br>What was not appreciated back then, however, was how adept OCDs are at keeping their disorder hidden. The effort they expend in scheming and lying often rivals that spent on the disorder. Afraid people will think they are crazy, OCD sufferers don't tell anyone about their illness--not their families or their friends, and certainly not their therapists. As Freud, who did not get much else right about OCD, astutely noted: "Sufferers [from OCD are able to keep their affliction a private matter. Concealment is made easier from the fact that they are quite well able to fulfill their social duties during a part of the day, once they have devoted a number of hours to their secret doings, hidden from view."<br><br>The true incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was not uncovered until 1983, when the National Institutes of Health announced the findings of the first large-scale study on the rate of occurrence of mental health disorders in the general population of the United States. Researchers went from door to door in five different areas of the country, carefully interviewing 18,500 randomly selected people. The results took mental health professionals completely by surprise: OCD was found to occur in 1.9-3.3 percent of the population! Although some researchers have questioned the reliability of the NIMH study on the grounds that its diagnostic criteria were not sufficiently stringent, there is general agreement that OCD's incidence is at least in the range of 1-2 percent.<br><br>The experts had misjudged OCD's incidence by a factor of more than twenty. Instead of 150,000 people having the disorder, millions have it. OCD turns out to be one of the most common of all mental illnesses, with large numbers of people suffering the disease in silence. Harvard's Michael Jenike, a leader in OCD research, has referred to it as mental health's "hidden epidemic."<br><br><b>OCD As a Biological Disorder</b><br><br>When I was in medical school, the leading theory on the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder was Freud's: Obsessions and compulsions arise from unconscious conflicts between instincts, particularly the sex drive, and attempts at self-control. Once widely accepted, this theory no longer holds sway. Extensive research in biochemistry, pharmacology, radiology, and genetics has now demonstrated beyond a doubt that OCD results directly from an abnormality in the brain's chemistry, a malfunction that leads to faulty firing of the brain's neurons. As succinctly put by Yale Medical School Professor Richard Peschel, "Recent neuroscience research proves that obsessive-compulsive disorder is a physical, neurobiological disease of the brain."<br><br>That a physical, not a psychological, abnormality accounts for OCD seems, at first, surprising, but the same discovery has been made in a number of other mental disorders. Neurosyphilis, a severe form of the venereal disease that causes heightened emotions and changes in behavior, and pellagra, a vitamin deficiency that leads to fatigue and anxiety, were once thought to be due to psychological conflicts. Early in the twentieth century, however, it became clear that both were entirely curable, biological diseases. More recently, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, two of the most severe psychiatric problems, have been demonstrated to be physical illnesses. As England's Richard Hunter, past president of the Royal Society of Medicine, has pointed out, "Progress in psychiatry is inevitably and inexorably from the psychological to the physical--never the other way around."<br><br>In the case of OCD it is crucial that this shift in perspective, from psychological to neurobiological, be fully accepted as quickly as possible. For one thing, many people are convinced that if a disorder is called "psychiatric," it is not real. Insurance companies, ever eager to find ways of denying payment, routinely assert this fallacy. What a terrible burden it is for disabled OCD sufferers to be viewed as people who are too weak to deal with life's stresses, or worse, as impostors trying to get out work.<br><br>Furthermore, OCD patients themselves readily embrace the new neurobiological view. In the past when I explained to my patients that they had a disorder caused by childhood conflicts, they often promptly disappeared from treatment. In the rural area where I practice, at least, people do not want to hear that they have deep-seated problems resulting from the way they were brought up. Now when I explain to patients that they have a medical disorder--an illness like diabetes or heart disease--they nod in agreement. For those who suffer the disorder, the physical explanation of OCD has the ring of truth.<br><br>Most importantly, the unlocking of the neurobiological underpinnings of OCD has led to new and potent treatments for the disorder.<br><br><b>Effective Treatment For OCD</b><br><br>Back in the early 1970s, there were no effective treatments for OCD. Now there are not just one but two that work: behavior therapy and a new group of "serotonergic" medications. These two new therapies represent truly spectacular advances in the treatment of mental disorder. Certainly, if these therapies had been available twenty years ago, and I had known then what I know now, I would have unhesitatingly used them to treat my own OCD. As I will mention later, I do currently use an anti-OCD medication.<br><br>Behavior therapy came on the scene first, in the late 1970s. Bearing no resemblance to psychoanalysis's hunt for hidden conflicts, behavior therapy's goal is simply to transform troublesome behaviors. In behavior therapy for OCD, obsessions and compulsions are first clearly identified, then rated in order of severity, and finally targeted for special homework assignments. Behavior therapy has turned out to be a remarkably successful treatment for OCD. A dozen good studies in the last fifteen years have reported significant improvement in 60-70 percent of patients. A 1994 study using an intensive program developed by Edna Foa of Medical College of Pennsylvania showed a marked reduction in obsessions and compulsions in more than 75 percent of the patients.<br><br>Only a few years after the introduction of behavior therapy, a group of medications affecting the brain chemical serotonin appeared as a second effective treatment for OCD. It is truly amazing that two totally different, potent therapies for OCD emerged in such a short span of time. Five members of the serotonergic group of medications are now available in the United States: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and clomipramine (Anafranil). All work to lessen obsessions and compulsions. Clomipramine has been the most studied of the group. A 1989 study of a large number of OCD patients from twenty-one different university centers in the United States showed that 60 percent of the patients treated with clomipramine were much improved, while the number much improved with placebo was less than 10 percent.<br><br>Like most OCD specialists, I routinely treat OCD with a combination of behavior therapy and serotonergic medications. Happily, the two cause no problems when used together. On the contrary, each seems to enhance the effect of the other. According to John Greist, M.D., OCD specialist from University of Wisconsin, "Medications and behavior therapy now are able to help go percent of people with OCD." This in a disorder recently thought to be hopeless.<br>My field of psychiatry--the branch of medicine that once brought you lobotomies and penis envy--has been getting things right lately. Tremendous progress has been made in the understanding and treatment of a number of syndromes, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit disorder. The advances in obsessive-compulsive disorder are the most impressive of all.<br><br>A good case can be made, in fact, that no other disorder in the history of medicine has ever experienced such an explosive growth in scientific understanding that has led to such a revolution in how it has been viewed: from regarded as rare to recognized as common; from presumed psychological to proven neurobiological; from written off as hopeless to accepted as one of the most responsive of all mental disorders to therapeutic interventions. All this has happened to OCD in about twenty years.</p><h2>Open: Get Ready for the Adventure of a Lifetime</h2><p><b>You&#x2019;ve accepted the invitation.

But women often face particular obstacles in ministry. What do we need to know about how women thrive?</strong> Mission researcher Mary Lederleitner interviewed and surveyed ninety-five respected women in mission leadership from thirty countries to gather their insights, expertise, and best practices. She unveils how women serve in distinctive ways and identifies key traits of faithful connected leaders. When women face opposition based on their gender, they employ various strategies to carry on with resilience and hope. Real-life stories and case studies shed light on dynamics that inhibit women and also give testimony to God's grace and empowerment in the midst of challenges. Women and men will find resources here for partnering together in effective ministry and mission. Organizations can help women flourish through advocacy, mentoring, and addressing structural issues. Wherever God has invited you to serve and lead, discover that you are not alone as you answer the call.</p><p>"This is an exceptional book and one of a kind. Men with Christian leadership responsibilities must read it. Too often men have allowed the issue of women using their leadership gifting and calling in the church and mission to polarize God's people. Sensitively into this arena, Mary Lederleitner provides helpful insights based on sound research. She brings us stories of dozens of women who serve the Lord in leadership roles around the world. These and Mary's analysis of them illustrate the contexts, complexities, challenges, and opportunities for women in leadership responsibilities. Mary's inquiry is well grounded and this gives her credibility to be read and heard. Her own leadership experiences and insights add to the impact of this book. Mary draws out insights that can be practically applied to a diversity of ministry contexts. Men need to read this book so that we may more effectively play our part in helping to ensure that Jesus' daughters are able to serve him in leadership roles. Let's remove the barriers that have stopped this from happening. We owe this to our sisters in Christ." (Kirk Franklin, executive director, Wycliffe Global Alliance)<br><br>"As the history of the church continues to unfold, inspiring momentum is building in this decade with yet another corrective movement of God's Spirit among his beloved people. This book is a new and deeper look at our theology of women, our traditions, and our stewardship of women's experiences, gifts, suffering, and potential. In an increasingly complex and connected world, Mary Lederleitner's research helps us consider what's at stake in this shifting paradigm. From the stories of women in an impressive variety of cultural settings, she highlights the faithfulness of God, and the example of Jesus who draws his daughters toward himself rather than following cultural convention. He compels them to love and serve out of who they are, even as they navigate expectations that could press them to be less. This book brings crucially needed perspectives, thoughtful challenges, and productive language to contribute to the remarkable transformation of God's image bearers, male and female together, in this critical window of redemptive history!" (Wendy Wilson, executive director of Women's Development Track, mission advisor for development of women at Missio Nexus)<br><br>"For years I have watched Mary use her gifts in missions, research, writing, and leadership. She lives the truth found in these pages. The gender discussion often devolves into arguing biblical positions. <em>Women in God's Mission</em> honors the wisdom and experience of women and men who share different understandings of women in ministry. Personal stories from all over the world build bridges that connect what God is doing to and through women. Let's continue the conversation so men and women heal and serve together for the glory of God." (Adele Ahlberg Calhoun, author, Spiritual Disciplines Handbook, copastor of spiritual formation, Highrock Arlington)<br><br>"Drawing on key lessons from history, the rich intercultural experiences of women across the various sectors of the global evangelical community, and her own extensive work as a mission leader with Wycliffe and other ministries, Mary Lederleitner has provided us with inviting and thoughtful reflections in <em>Women in God's Mission</em>. Sensitive to the different perspectives in churches and denominations regarding egalitarian and complementarian perspectives, Lederleitner seeks to move beyond current polarizations by sharing the stories of respected women from about thirty countries with the goal of helping women and men think deeply about leadership and service in God's mission. Calling on her readers to find their identity in God, to focus on faithfulness in service, to understand contextual challenges, and to prioritize collaborative leadership approaches, Lederleitner hopes to see the influence of a new generation&#x2015; in continuity with Deborah and Esther, Priscilla and Lydia, Amy Carmichael and Corrie ten Boom, Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks, Lottie Moon and Annie Armstrong&#x2015; not only continue but expand for the generations to come. While some may wish for more extensive scriptural and theological engagement, the application questions at the conclusion of each chapter combined with the action steps in the final section of the book create abundant opportunities for readers to reflect further about these important matters. <em>Women in God's Mission</em> offers a significant contribution to the questions regarding service and leadership for the global church in the twenty-first century." (David S. Dockery, president, Trinity International University and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Mary Lederleitner is a champion for Christ who dedicates her life to seeing his purposes fulfilled in the world. Now through <em>Women in God's Mission</em> she combines her own experience with that of female evangelical leaders from all over the world to inform, inspire, and empower daughters of Christ to do the same while navigating common barriers that may discourage them. <em>Women in God's Mission</em> is an invaluable guide for women in ministry, both at home and in the mission field." (Bob Creson, president and CEO of Wycliffe Bible Translators USA)<br><br>"Godly, influential female leaders are stepping into key ministry roles all around the world. Their voices need to be heard. Mary Lederleitner's listening and analytical skills have resulted in a highly valuable book that provides a way for all of us&#x2015;men and women alike&#x2015;to learn from those she calls 'God's extraordinary daughters.' Anyone who wants to partner effectively in a global context will find fresh insights here to better understand and support worthy women leaders."

She has a PhD from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and an MA in intercultural studies from Wheaton College, and teaches as an adjunct professor at both institutions.

There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.<b>One</b><p>She spent the morning with a murderer.</p><p>He'd been under guard in a hospital bed recovering from a near-fatal wound&#x2014;courtesy of a misstep by his partner in crime&#x2014;but she'd had no sympathy.</p><p>She was glad he'd lived, wished him a long, long life&#x2014;in an off-planet concrete cage. She believed the case she and her team had built to be solid&#x2014;as did the nearly gleeful prosecuting attorney. The sprinkles on the icing of this particular cupcake was the confession she'd finessed out of him as he'd sneered at her.</p><p>Given that he'd tried to kill her less than twenty-four hours before, the sneer was small change.</p><p>Sylvester Moriarity would receive the best medical care New York could provide, then he'd join his friend Winston Dudley behind bars until what promised to be a sensational, media-soaked trial, given their family fortunes and names.</p><p>Case closed, she told herself as she pushed her way through the heat-soaked Saturday afternoon traffic toward home. The dead now had the only justice she could offer, and their families and friends the comfort&#x2014;if comfort it was&#x2014;that those responsible would pay.</p><p>But it haunted her: the waste, the cruelty, the utter selfishness of two men who were so puffed up by their own importance, their <i>station</i>, that they'd considered murder a form of entertainment, a twisted sort of indulgence.</p><p>She maneuvered through New York traffic, barely hearing the blasts of horns, the annoyingly cheerful hype of the ad blimps heralding midsummer sales at the Sky Mall. Tourists swarmed the city&#x2014;and likely the Sky Mall as well&#x2014;chowing down on soy dogs from the smoking glide-carts, looking for souvies and bargains among the shops and street vendors.</p><p>A boiling stew, she thought, in the heat and humidity of summer 2060.</p><p>She caught the lightning move of a nimble-fingered street thief, bumping through a couple of tourists more intent on gawking at the buildings and their ringing people glides than their own security. He had the wallet in the goody slit of his baggy cargos in half a finger snap and slithered like a snake through the forest of people lumbering across the crosswalk.</p><p>If she'd been on foot, or at least headed in the same direction, she'd have pursued&#x2014;and the chase might've lifted her mood. But he and his booty smoked away, and he'd no doubt continue to score well on today's target shoot.</p><p>Life went on.</p><p>When Lieutenant Eve Dallas finally drove through the stately gates of home, she reminded herself of that again. Life went on&#x2014;and in her case, today, that included a cookout, a horde of cops, and her odd assortment of friends. A couple years before, it would've been the last way she'd have spent a Saturday, but things had changed.</p><p>Her living arrangements certainly had, from a sparsely furnished apartment to the palace-fortress Roarke had built. Her husband&#x2014;and <i>that</i> was a change, even if they'd just celebrated their second year of marriage&#x2014;had the vision, the need, and, God knew, the means to create the gorgeous home with its myriad rooms filled with style and function. Here the grass was rich summer green, the trees and flowers plentiful.</p><p>Here was peace and warmth and welcome. And she needed them, maybe just a little desperately at the moment.</p><p>She left her vehicle at the front entrance, knowing Summerset, Roarke's majordomo, would send it to its place in the garage. And hoped, just this once, he wasn't looming like a scarecrow in the foyer. </p><p>She wanted the cool and quiet of the bedroom she shared with Roarke, a few minutes of solitude. Time, she thought as she strode toward the doors, to shake off this mood before the invasion.</p><p>Halfway to the doors, she stopped. The front wasn't the only way in, for Christ's sake&#x2014;and why hadn't she ever thought of that before? On impulse, she jogged around&#x2014;long legs eating up ground&#x2014;crossed one of the patios, turned through a small, walled garden, and went in through a side door. Into a parlor or sitting room or morning room&#x2014;who knew? she thought with a roll of tired brown eyes&#x2014;and made her way as sneakily as the street thief across the hallway, down and into the more familiar territory of the game room, where she knew the lay of the land.</p><p>She called the elevator and considered it a small, personal victory when the doors shut her in. "Master bedroom," she ordered, then just leaned back against the wall, shut her eyes, while the unit navigated its way.</p><p>When she stepped into the bedroom, she raked a hand through her messy cap of brown hair, stripped the jacket off her lanky frame, and tossed it at the handiest chair. She stepped onto the platform and sat on the side of the lake-sized bed. If she'd believed she could escape into sleep, she'd have stretched out, but there was too much in her head, in her belly, for rest.</p><p>So she simply sat, veteran cop, Homicide lieutenant who'd walked through blood and death more times than she could count, and mourned a little.</p><p>Roarke found her there.</p><p>He could gauge her state of mind by the slump of her shoulders, by the way she sat, staring out the window. He walked to her, sat beside her, took her hand.</p><p>"I should've gone with you."</p><p>She shook her head but leaned against him. "No place for civilians in Interview, and nothing you could've done anyway if I'd stretched it and brought you in as expert consultant. I had him cold and cut through his battalion of expensive lawyers like a fucking machete. I thought the PA was going to kiss me on the mouth."</p><p>He brought the hand he held to his lips. "And still you're sad."</p><p>She closed her eyes, comforted a little by the solidity of him beside her, by that whisper of Ireland in his voice, even by the scent so uniquely him. "Not sad, or... I don't know what the hell I am. I should be buzzed. I did the job; I slammed it shut&#x2014;and I got to look them both in the face and let them know it."</p><p>She shoved up, paced to the window, away again, and realized it wasn't peace and comfort she wanted after all. Not quite yet. It was a place to let it go, let it out, spew the rage.</p><p>"He was pissed. Moriarity. Lying there with that hole in his chest his pal put into him with his freaking antique Italian foil."</p><p>"The one meant for you," Roarke reminded her.</p><p>"Yeah. And he's pissed, seriously pissed, Dudley missed and it wasn't me on a slab at the morgue."</p><p>"I expect he was," Roarke said coolly. "But that's not what's got you going."</p><p>She paused a minute, just looked at him. Stunning blue eyes in a stunning face, the mane of thick black hair, that poet's mouth set firm now because she'd made him think of her on that slab at the morgue.</p><p>"You know they never had a chance to take me. You were there."</p><p>"And still he drew blood, didn't he?" Roarke nodded at the healing wound on her arm.</p><p>She tapped it. "And this helped sew them up. Attempted murder of a police officer just trowels on the icing. They didn't make their next score. Now they have to end their competition with a tie, which oddly enough is what I think they always wanted. They just planned for the contest to go on a lot longer. And you know what the prize was at the end? Do you know what the purse for this goddamn tournament was?"</p><p>"I don't, no, but I see you got it out of Moriarity today."</p><p>"Yeah, I wound him up so tight he had to let it spring out. A dollar. A fucking dollar, Roarke&#x2014;just one big joke between them. And it makes me sick."</p><p>It shocked, even appalled her a little, that her eyes stung, that she felt tears pressing hard. "It makes me sick," she repeated. "All those people dead, all those lives broken and shattered, and <i>this</i> makes me sick? I don't know why, I just don't know why it churns my stomach. I've seen worse. God, we've both seen worse."</p><p>"But rarely more futile." He stood, took her arms, gently rubbing. "No reason, no mad vendetta or fevered dream, no vengeance or greed or fury. Just a cruel game. Why shouldn't it make you sick? It does me as well."</p><p>"I contacted the next of kin," she began. "Even the ones we found from before they started this matchup in New York. That's why I'm late getting back. I thought I needed to, and thought if I closed it all the way, I'd feel better. I got gratitude. I got anger and tears, everything you expect. And every one of them asked me why. Why had these men killed their daughter, their husband, their mother?"</p><p>"And what did you tell them?"</p><p>"Sometimes there's no why, or not one we can understand." She squeezed her eyes tight. "I want to be pissed."</p><p>"You are, under it. And under that, you know you did good work. And you're alive, darling Eve." He drew her in to kiss her brow. "Which, to take this to their level, makes them losers."</p><p>"I guess it does. I guess that's going to have to be enough."</p><p>She took his face in her hands, smiled a little. "And there's the added bonus that they hate us both. Really hate us. That adds a boost."</p><p>"I can't think of anyone I'd rather be hated by, or anyone I'd rather be hated with."</p><p>Now the smile moved into her eyes. "Me either. If I keep that front and center, I could be in the mood to party. I guess we should go down and do whatever we're supposed to do before everybody gets here."</p><p>"Change first. You'll feel more in the party mode without your boots and weapon."</p><p>By the time she'd changed trousers for cotton pants, boots for skids, and made it downstairs, she heard voices in the foyer. She spotted her partner, Peabody, her short, dark ponytail bouncing, summery dress swirling. Peabody's cohab, e-detective and premier geek McNab, stood beside her in a skin tank crisscrossed with more colors than an atomic rainbow paired with baggy, hot pink knee shorts and gel flips.</p><p>He turned, the forest of silver rings on his left earlobe shimmering, and shot Eve a wide grin. "Hey, Dallas. We brought you something."</p><p>"My granny's homemade wine." Peabody held up the bottle. "I know you've got a wine cellar the size of California, but we thought you'd get a charge. It's good stuff." </p><p>"Let's go out and open it up. I'm ready for some good stuff."</p><p>Peabody kept eye contact, quirked her brows. "All okay?"</p><p>"The PA's probably still doing his happy dance. Case closed," she said, and left out the rest. No point in adding the details now that would leave her partner as troubled as she'd been.</p><p>"We'll have the first drink with a toast to the NYPSD's Homicide&#x2014;and Electronic Detectives divisions," Roarke said with a wink for McNab.</p><p>The wide stone terrace held tables already loaded with food and shaded by umbrellas, and the gardens exploded with color and scent. The monster grill Roarke had conquered&#x2014;mostly&#x2014;looked formidable, and the wine was indeed good stuff.</p><p>Within thirty minutes, the scent of grilling meat mixed with the perfume of summer flowers. The terrace, the chairs around the tables, the gardens filled with people. It still amazed her she'd somehow collected so many.</p><p>Her cops&#x2014;everyone who'd worked the Dudley-Moriarity case&#x2014;along with Cher Reo, the ADA, newlyweds Dr. Louise DiMatto and retired licensed companion Charles Monroe stood, sat, lounged, or stuffed their faces.</p><p>Morris, the ME who'd inspired the impulse for her to arrange this shindig to help with his lingering grief over his murdered love, shared a brew with Father Lopez, who'd become his friend and counselor.</p><p>Sort of weird having a priest at a party&#x2014;even one she liked and respected&#x2014;but at least he wasn't wearing the getup.</p><p>Nadine Furst, bestselling author and ace reporter, chatted happily with Dr. Mira, department shrink, and Mira's adorable husband, Dennis.</p><p>It was good, she decided, to blow off steam this way, to gather together to do it, even if gathering together wasn't as natural for her as for some. It was good to watch Feeney kibitz Roarke's grill technique, and watch Trueheart show off his pretty, shy-eyed girlfriend.</p><p>Hell, she might just have another glass of Granny Peabody's wine and&#x2014;</p><p>The thought winged away when she heard the bright laugh.</p><p>Mavis Freestone rushed out on silver sandals that laced past the hem of her flippy, thigh-baring lavender skirt. Her hair, perched in a crowning tail, matched the skirt. In her arms she carried baby Bella. Leonardo, beaming at his girls, followed. </p> <p>"Dallas!"</p><p>"I thought you were in London," Eve said when she was enveloped in color and scent and joy.</p><p>"We couldn't miss a party! We'll go back tomorrow. Trina stopped off to talk to Summerset."</p><p>Eve felt her skin chill. "Trina..."</p><p>"Don't worry, she's here to party, not to give you a treatment. She did Bella's hair&#x2014;isn't it mag?"</p><p>A half a zillion sunny curls surrounded the baby's happy face. Every single one bounced with tiny pink bows.</p><p>"Yeah, it's&#x2014;"</p><p>"Oh, everybody who counts is here! I've got to give out squeezes. Here, hold Bellamisa a minute."</p><p>"I'll get us a drink." Leonardo patted Eve's head with his huge hand, then glided away in his calf-baring red crops.</p><p>"I&#x2014;" As Eve's arms were immediately loaded with bouncing, gooing baby, the protest ended on a strangled gulp.</p><p>"Got some weight to you these days," Eve managed, then scanned the crowd for a sucker to pass the load to. Bella squealed, sending Eve's heart rate soaring, then grabbed a fistful of Eve's hair, tugged with surprising force.</p><p>And planted a wet, openmouthed kiss on Eve's cheek. "Slooch!" said Bella.</p><p>"What does that mean? Oh God."</p><p>"Smooch," Mavis called out, gesturing with a frothy pink drink. "She wants you to kiss her back."</p><p>"Man. Okay, fine." Gingerly, Eve pecked her lips at Bella's cheek.</p><p>Obviously pleased, Bella let out a laugh so like Mavis's, Eve grinned. "Okay, kid, let's go find someone else for you to slooch." </p></p><h2>Which Bible Would Jesus Use? The Bible Version Controversy Explained and Resolved</h2><p>Want to settle the 'Bible Version controversy' once and for all?" You know how people get all upset and sometimes angry when someone talks about one bible version being better than another? It happens a lot in Bible studies because the differences in versions are painfully obvious to all. And because of all the glaring differences and discrepancies in the different Bible versions, the Lord himself is forced to pick just one of them. Everyone's got an opinion as to which Bible is best. The funny thing is that hardly anyone ever considers the opinion of the Lord Jesus Christ. Don't you think he has a preference? Which Bible Would Jesus Use? proves that he does. And you can depend upon him to pick the "right one." Which one would he use? The evidence shows that it's the same brand he's been using for the past 400 years. Once you know for sure which Bible the Lord has already chosen and why, you'll never again have any doubts about "which Bible" is truly God's Bible. And you'll be able to convince others once you've shown them... � Why the Lord Jesus Christ would never use the ESV because of the known errors (admitted by experts) inserted into the text in Matthew 1:7, 8, &amp; 10. � Why the Lord wouldn't carry the NASB to church with him because of the known errors (admitted by experts) inserted into the text in John 7:8-10 and because of the way it refers to him in John 1:18. � Why the Lord couldn't use the NIV, ESV, or the NASB because of the known geography error (admitted by experts) inserted into the text in Luke 4:44. � Why the Lord can't use the NIV, ESV, or the NASB because of the known error (admitted by experts) inserted into the text in Mark 1:2. � Why the Lord is hurt by how his character is besmirched in Mark 1:41 in the NIV and would never, ever use it. � Why the Lord wouldn't bring the NKJV into church with him because of how it undermines the historical integrity of his words in English.</p><p>&#x201c;The Devil Has Seeded the Christian Church With Many Different False Bibles.

She tells people her hobbies are photography and hiking, but they&#39;re really collecting candy bar wrappers and searching for buried treasure with her metal detector. Wendy lives with her family in New Jersey. Visit her at www.wendymass.com.Gr 4-7-This installment in the series tells of Beauty, a plain girl whose life drastically changes after a fire destroys her father's business, and Riley, a prince who would rather gaze at the stars than dance at lavish balls. When a mischievous witch turns Riley into a hideous beast and renders his family completely invisible, he must find a girl to love him before his time runs out. Told in alternating viewpoints, this is an appealing fairy-tale spin-off. The characters and dialogue emphasize the importance of family strength in times of adversity. Both Beauty's and Riley's families face serious problems, but they handle their issues with integrity, humor, and courage. At times, however, the dialogue doesn't sound authentic and seems pieced together with little or no transition. Pacing is also a concern. The stories meander through lots of events before the two finally meet, but they all seem random and do little to enhance the plot. It isn't until about 70 pages from the end that the traditional story begins, leaving some to wonder what took so long. Still, Mass and fairy-tale retellings are popular with tweens, and librarians looking for light, nonviolent retellings will find that Beauty fits the bill nicely.-Leigh Collazo, Ed Willkie Middle School, Fort Worth, TX&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

American by birth, she was educated at Loyola University, the University of Virginia and Christ Church, Oxford. After a distinguished teaching career, she entered religious life in 1985. For 22 years until her early death from cancer she guided the young nuns of her abbey with enthusiasm, wisdom and wit.</p><p>The spirituality to be found in the pages of this book demonstrates to the reader why her influence should have been so great and so deep. Her notes to the novices deal with issues of relevance to a world beyond the cloister: What is the meaning of suffering? How do we cope with living with people who annoy us? How do we relate to a God we cannot see? How do we make the big decisions of life?</p><p>Sister Mary David&#x2019;s teaching was both profound and intensely practical, suffused with faith in God&#x2019;s joy in our work, leisure, community and family life but above all in our view and understanding of ourselves. This book, with an introduction by Abbot Erik Varden OCSO (author of<i> The Shattering of Loneliness)</i> shows us how to realize the Joy that is God.</p></p><p>Sister <b>Mary David</b> Totah OSB (1957-2017) was a Benedictine nun. American by birth, after a stellar Oxford degree and PhD, she joined the Benedictine Community at Ryde in the Isle of Wight. Her books include <i>The Spirit of Solemnes</i>, <i>A Divine Gift</i>, <i>The Consecrated Life</i> and <i>In the House of Christ.</i><p>&#x201c;A corpus of spiritual sagacity&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Catholic Herald</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sr Mary David had an exceptional gift for friendship. <i>The Joy of God</i>, drawn from her notes, letters, and talks to novices ... shows why. Her joy, which was her hallmark, was a gift but it was also a choice, the fruit of effort, of very great, consistent generosity and courage, and of suffering. She was a disciple of joy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Tablet</i></p><p>&#x201c;If ever a book title conveyed its content, this one certainly does ... That theme of joy, rooted in Christ, runs throughout the chapters, which have been skilfully put together from talks and letters to her novices. They deal with subjects such as growth, freedom, and darkness, and, while written for enclosed nuns, show how such a life develops deep insights into universal subjects. Liberally sprinkled with useful quotations from saints great and small, the book is easy to read. The chapters address how we are to grow in our consecration to Christ, whether that be through baptism or religious profession.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Church Times</i></p></p><h2>Amphibians of Costa Rica: A Field Guide (Zona Tropical Publications)</h2><p><p><i>Amphibians of Costa Rica</i> is the first in-depth field guide to all 206 species of amphibians known to occur in Costa Rica or within walking distance of its borders. A diminutive nation with abundant natural wealth, the country is host to 146 species of frogs and toads. Frogs of gemlike beauty and dizzying variety abound: some species can fit on the end of a human finger; others would take two hands to hold. In the rainforests, you can find frogs capable of gliding from high in the treetops to the forest floor, some that carry their eggs or their tadpoles around on their back, and others that secrete glue-like substances from their skin that are capable of sticking shut the mouth of attacking snakes. </p><p>Costa Rica is also home to fifty-three species of lungless salamanders, whose unique adaptations and abilities have allowed them to colonize habitats inaccessible to other amphibians.

Toronto woke that morning to see itself cloaked and made over in white, and it was only November.</p><p>Cutting across Nathan Philips Square in front of the twin curves of the City Hall, Dave Martyniuk walked as carefully as he could and wished he&#x2019;d worn boots. As he maneuvered toward the restaurant entrance on the far side, he saw with some surprise that the other three were already waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Dave,&#x201d; said sharp-eyed Kevin Laine. &#x201c;A new suit! When did this happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, everyone,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;I got it last week. Can&#x2019;t wear the same corduroy jackets all year, can I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A deep truth,&#x201d; said Kevin, grinning. He was wearing jeans and a sheepskin jacket. And boots. Having finished the obligatory apprenticeship with a law firm that Dave had just begun, Kevin was now immersed in the equally tedious if less formal six-month Bar Admission course. &#x201c;If that is a three-piece suit,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;my image of you is going to be irrevocably shattered.&#x201d;</p><p>Wordlessly, Dave unbuttoned his overcoat to reveal the shattering navy vest beneath.</p><p>&#x201c;Angels and ministers of grace defend us!&#x201d; Kevin exclaimed, crossing himself with the wrong hand while making the sign against evil with the other. Paul Schafer laughed. &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Kevin said, &#x201c;it looks very nice. Why didn&#x2019;t you buy it in your size?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Kev, give him a break!&#x201d; Kim Ford said. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> nice, Dave, and it fits perfectly. Kevin&#x2019;s feeling scruffy and jealous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not,&#x201d; Kevin protested. &#x201c;I am simply giving my buddy a hard time. If I can&#x2019;t tease Dave, who can I tease?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Dave. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tough, I can take it.&#x201d; But what he was remembering in that moment was the face of Kevin Laine the spring before, in a room in the Park Plaza Hotel. The face, and the flat, harshly mastered voice in which he&#x2019;d spoken, looking down at the wreckage of a woman on the floor:</p><p><i>&#x201c;To this I will make reply although he be a god and it mean my death.&#x201d;</i></p><p>You gave some latitude, Dave was thinking, to someone who&#x2019;d sworn an oath like that, even if his style was more than occasionally jarring. You gave latitude because what Kevin had done that evening was give voice, and not for the only time, to the mute rage in one&#x2019;s own heart.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kim Ford softly, and Dave knew that she was responding to his thought and not his flippant words. Which would have been unsettling, were she not who she was, with her white hair, the green bracelet on her wrist, and the red ring on her finger that had blazed to bring them home. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in,&#x201d; Kim said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve things to talk about.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Schafer, the Twiceborn, had already turned to lead them through the door.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>How many shadings, Kevin was thinking, are there to helplessness? He remembered the feeling from the year before, watching Paul twist inward on himself in the months after Rachel Kincaid had died. A bad time, that was. But Paul had come out of it, had gone so far in three nights on the Summer Tree in Fionavar that he was beyond understanding in the most important ways. He was healed, though, and Kevin held to that as a gift from Fionavar, some recompense for what had been done to Jennifer by the god named Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller. Though recompense was hardly the word; there was no true compensation to be found in this or any other world, only the hope of retribution, a flame so faint, despite what he had sworn, it scarcely burned. What were any of them against a god? Even Kim, with her Sight, even Paul, even Dave, who had changed among the Dalrei on the Plain and had found a horn in Pendaran Wood.</p><p>And who was he, Kevin Laine, to swear an oath of revenge? It all seemed so pathetic, so ridiculous, especially here, eating fillet of sole in the Mackenzie King Dining Room, amid the clink of cutlery and the lunchtime talk of lawyers and civil servants.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; said Paul, in a tone that made their setting instantly irrelevant. He was looking at Kim. &#x201c;Have you seen anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Stop pushing. If anything happens I&#x2019;ll tell you. Do you want it in writing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, Kim,&#x201d; Kevin said. &#x201c;You have to understand how ignorant we feel. You&#x2019;re our only link.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not linked to anything now, and that&#x2019;s all there is to it. There&#x2019;s a place I have to find and I can&#x2019;t control my dreaming. It&#x2019;s in this world, that&#x2019;s all I know, and I can&#x2019;t go anywhere or do anything until I find it. Do you think I&#x2019;m enjoying this any more than you three are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you send us back?&#x201d; Dave asked, unwisely.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not a goddamned subway system!&#x201d; Kim snapped. &#x201c;I got us out because the Baelrath was somehow unleashed. I can&#x2019;t do it on command.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which means we&#x2019;re stuck here,&#x201d; Kevin said.</p><p>&#x201c;Unless Loren comes for us,&#x201d; Dave amended.</p><p>Paul was shaking his head. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Dave asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Loren&#x2019;s playing hands-off, I think. He set things in motion, but he&#x2019;s leaving it up to us now, and some of the others.&#x201d;</p><p>Kim was nodding. &#x201c;He put a thread in the loom,&#x201d; she murmured, &#x201c;but he won&#x2019;t weave this tapestry.&#x201d; She and Paul exchanged a glance.</p><p>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; Dave persisted. Kevin could hear the big man&#x2019;s frustration. &#x201c;He needs us&#x2014;or at least Kim and Paul. Why won&#x2019;t he come for us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of Jennifer,&#x201d; said Paul quietly. After a moment he went on. &#x201c;He thinks we&#x2019;ve suffered enough. He won&#x2019;t impose anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Kevin cleared his throat. &#x201c;As I understand it, though, whatever happens in Fionavar is going to be reflected here and in the other worlds too, wherever they are. Isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; said Kim calmly. &#x201c;It is true. Not immediately, perhaps, but if Rakoth takes dominion in Fionavar he takes dominion everywhere. There is only one Tapestry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; said Paul, &#x201c;we have to do it on our own. Loren won&#x2019;t demand it. If the four of us want to go back, we&#x2019;ll have to find a way ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The four of us?&#x201d; Kevin said. So much helplessness. He looked at Kim.</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know. She won&#x2019;t see the three of you. She never goes out of the house. She talks to me about work and the weather, and the news, and she&#x2019;s, she&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s going ahead with it,&#x201d; Paul Schafer said.</p><p>Kimberly nodded.</p><p>Golden, she had been, Kevin remembered, from inside the sorrow.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn now.&#x201d;</p><p>Arrow of the God.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had a peephole placed in the door so she could see who was knocking. She was home most of the day, except for afternoon walks in the park nearby. There were often people at the door: deliveries, the gas man, registered mail. For a while at the beginning there had been, fatuously, flowers. She&#x2019;d thought Kevin was smarter than that. She didn&#x2019;t care whether or not that was a fair judgment. She&#x2019;d had a fight with Kim about it, when her roommate had come home one evening to find roses in the garbage can.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have any idea how he&#x2019;s feeling? Don&#x2019;t you care?&#x201d; Kimberly had shouted.</p><p>Answer: no, and no.</p><p>How could she come to such a human thing as caring, anymore? Numberless, the unbridged chasms between where she now was, and the four of them, and everyone else. To everything there yet clung the odor of the swan. She saw the world through the filtered unlight of Starkadh. What voice, what eyes seen through that green distortion, could efface the power of Rakoth, who had shoveled through her mind and body as if she, who had once been loved and whole, were so much slag?</p><p>She knew she was sane, did not know why.</p><p>One thing only pulled her forward into some future tense. Not a good thing, nor could it have been, but it was real, and random, and hers. She would not be gainsaid.</p><p>And so, when Kim had first told the other three, and they had come in July to argue with her, she had stood up and left the room. Nor had she seen Kevin or Dave or Paul since that day.</p><p>She would bear this child, the child of Rakoth Maugrim. She intended to die giving birth.</p><p>She would not have let him in, except that she saw that he was alone, and this was sufficiently unexpected to cause her to open the door.</p><p>Paul Schafer said, &#x201c;I have a story to tell. Will you listen?&#x201d;</p><p>It was cold on the porch. After a moment she stepped aside and he entered. She closed the door and walked into the living room. He hung up his coat in the hall closet and followed her.</p><p>She had taken the rocking chair. He sat down on the couch and looked at her, tall and fair, still graceful though no longer slim, seven months heavy with the child. Her head was high, her wide-set green eyes uncompromising.</p><p>&#x201c;I walked away from you last time, and I will again, Paul. I will not be moved on this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said, a story,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Then tell it.&#x201d;</p><p>So he told her for the first time about the grey dog on the wall of Paras Derval and the fathomless sorrow in its eyes; he told her about his second night on the Summer Tree, when Galadan, whom she also knew, had come for him, and how the dog had appeared again, and of the battle fought here in the M�rnirwood. He told her about being bound on the Tree of the God, and seeing the red moon rise and the grey dog drive the wolf from the wood.</p><p>He told her of Dana. And M�rnir. The powers shown forth that night in answer to the Darkness in the north. His voice was deeper than she remembered; there were echoes in it.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;We are not in this alone. He may break us into fragments in the end, but he will not be unresisted, and whatever you may have seen or endured in that place you must understand that he cannot shape the pattern exactly to his desire. Or else you would not be here.&#x201d;</p><p>She listened, almost against her will. His words brought back words of her own, spoken in Starkadh itself: <i>You will have nothing of me that you do not take</i>, she had said. But that was before. Before he had set about taking everything&#x2014;until Kim had pulled her out.</p><p>She lifted her head a little. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Paul said, his eyes never leaving her face. &#x201c;Do you understand? He is stronger than any of us, stronger even than the God who sent me back. He is stronger than you, Jennifer; it is not worth saying except for this: he cannot take away what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know this,&#x201d; said Jennifer Lowell. &#x201c;It is why I will bear his child.&#x201d;</p><p>He sat back. &#x201c;Then you become his servant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You listen to me now, Paul, because you don&#x2019;t know everything either. When he left me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after, he gave me to a Dwarf. Bl�d was his name. I was a reward, a toy, but he said something to the Dwarf: he said I was to be killed, <i>and that there was a reason.</i>&#x201d; There was cold resolution in her voice. &#x201c;I will bear this child because I am alive when he wished me dead&#x2014;the child is random, it is outside his purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>He was silent a long time. Then, &#x201c;But so are you, in and of yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Her laugh was a brutal sound. &#x201c;And how am I, in and of myself, to answer him? I am going to have a son, Paul, and he will be my answer.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;There is too much evil in this, and only to prove a point already proven.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonetheless,&#x201d; said Jennifer.</p><p>After a moment his mouth crooked sideways. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t press you on it, then. I came for you, not him. Kim&#x2019;s already dreamt his name, anyhow.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes flashed. &#x201c;Paul, understand me. I would do what I am doing whatever Kim said. Whatever she happened to dream. And I will name him as I choose!&#x201d;</p><p>He was smiling, improbably. &#x201c;Stick around and do that then. Stay with us, Jen. We need you back.&#x201d; Only when he spoke did she realize what she&#x2019;d said. He&#x2019;d tricked her, she decided, had goaded her quite deliberately into something unintended. But she couldn&#x2019;t, for some reason, feel angry. Had this first tenuous spar he&#x2019;d thrown across to her been a little firmer she might, in fact, have smiled.</p><p>Paul stood up. &#x201c;There is an exhibition of Japanese prints at the Art Gallery. Would you like to see it with me?&#x201d;</p><p>For a long time she rocked in the chair, looking up at him. He was dark-haired, slight, still frail-seeming, though not so much as last spring.</p><p>&#x201c;What was the dog&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I did.&#x201d;</p><p>After another moment she rose, put on her coat, and took her first careful step on the first bridge.</p><p>Dark seed of a dark god, Paul was thinking, as he tried to simulate an interest in nineteenth-century prints from Kyoto and Osaka. Cranes, twisted trees, elegant ladies with long pins in their hair.</p><p>The lady beside him wasn&#x2019;t talking a great deal, but she was there in the gallery, and it was not a small grace. He remembered the crumpled figure she had been seven months before, when Kim had brought them desperately from Fionavar with the wild, blazing power of the Baelrath.</p><p>This was Kim&#x2019;s power, he knew: the Warstone and the dreams in which she walked at night, white-haired as Ysanne had been, two souls within her, and knowledge of two worlds. It had to be a difficult thing. <i>The price of power</i>, he remembered Ailell the High King telling him, the night they played their game of ta&#x2019;bael. The night that had been overture to the three nights that became his own hard, hardest thing. The gateway to whatever he now was, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p><p>Whatever he now was. They had moved into the twentieth century now: more cranes, long, narrow mountain scenes, low boats riding on wide rivers.</p><p>&#x201c;The themes don&#x2019;t change much,&#x201d; Jennifer said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d;</p><p>He had been sent back, he was M�rnir&#x2019;s response, but he had no ring with which to burn, no dreams down which to track the secrets of the Tapestry, not even a horn such as Dave had found, no skylore like Loren, or crown like Aileron; not even&#x2014;though he felt a chill at the thought&#x2014;a child within him like the woman at his side.</p><p>And yet. There had been ravens at his shoulder in the branches of the Tree: Thought and Memory were their names. There had been a figure in the clearing, hard to see, but he had seen horns on its head and seen it bow to him. There had been the white mist rising up through him to the sky in which a red moon sailed on new moon night. There had been rain. And then the God.</p><p>And there was still the God. At night, sometimes, he could feel the tacit presence, immense, in the rush and slide of his blood, the muffled thunder of his human heart.</p><p>Was he a symbol only? A manifestation of what he had been telling Jennifer: the presence of opposition to the workings of the Unraveller? There were worse roles, he supposed. It gave him a part to play in what was to come, but something within&#x2014;and there was a god within him&#x2014;said that there was more. <i>No man shall be Lord of the Summer Tree who has not twice been born</i>, Jaelle had said to him in the sanctuary.</p><p>He was more than symbol. The waiting to learn what, and how, seemed to be part of the price.</p><p>Almost at the end now. They stopped in front of a large print of a river scene: boats being poled along, others unloading at a crowded dock; there were woods on the far side of the stream, snowcapped mountains beyond. It was badly hung, though; he could see people behind them reflected in the glass, two students, the sleepy gu...</p></p><h2>Pastel Orphans</h2><p><p>In 1930s Berlin, young Henrik, the son of a Jewish father and Aryan mother, watches the world around him crumbling: people are rioting in the streets, a strange yellow star begins appearing in shop windows, and friends are forced to move&#x2014;or they simply disappear.</p><p>After his father becomes gravely ill, Henrik and his little sister, Greta, are taken by their mother to Poland for safety.

There's a longing for something more, something that makes us feel like we belong, something that resonates perfectly with who we were made to be.

And they&nbsp;tell the inside story of one of the most amazing grassroots political campaigns ever run.</p> <p>Fast-paced, provocative, and profound, <em>Rules for Revolutionaries</em> stands as a liberating challenge to the low expectations and small thinking that dominates too many advocacy, non-profit, and campaigning organizations&#x2015;and points the way forward to a future where political revolution is truly possible.</p></p><p><p>Becky Bond served as a senior advisor on the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and was an architect of the campaign&#x2019;s national, volunteer-driven grassroots campaign. Prior to joining the Bernie Sanders campaign, Becky served as political director at CREDO where she was an innovator working at the intersection of organizing, politics, and technology for over a decade. Becky is a cofounder of CREDO SuperPAC, which was named by <em>Mother Jones</em> as one &#x201c;2012&#x2019;s Least Horrible Super-PACs&#x201d; for helping to defeat five sitting Tea Party Republican Congressmen. She lives in San Francisco, California, with the writer, designer, and book artist Emily McVarish.

Zack was a union organizer before becoming MoveOn.org&#x2019;s first organizing director in its campaign to prevent the war in Iraq in 2003. As an early advisor to the Howard Dean campaign, he helped transfer MoveOn.org&#x2019;s early fundraising and organizing discoveries into presidential politics, and he then served as John Kerry&#x2019;s director of online fundraising and communications in the general election where his team raised more than $100 million online for the nominee. Subsequently, Zack worked as a consultant to global NGOs, campaigns, and companies, and served as Wikipedia&#x2019;s chief community officer and chief revenue officer.

Bond and Exley argue convincingly that the old-school organizing techniques embodied in Saul Alinsky&#x2019;s classic <em>Rules for Radicals </em>fall short in the 21st-century age of social media. They divide their commentary into 22 rules, illustrated by examples from the campaign. They cover basics like fund-raising, phone banking, and intraorganization communication, but the heart of their theory is 'big organizing.' The idea is that people will organize around issues that are fundamental and speak to &#x201c;big target universes,&#x201d; such as making public college free, or providing universal health care. Along with identifying issues that matter to lots of people, the new rules embrace a structure that gives power to volunteers. Bond and Exley also argue that good management is not counter-revolutionary and note the dangers of management by consensus. The successes of the Sanders campaign gives credibility to this new organizing paradigm, and Bond and Exley&#x2019;s valuable and pragmatic road map will appeal to those interested in social change, whether they&#x2019;re organizing presidential campaigns or neighborhood efforts.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Bernie Sanders&#x2019;s&nbsp;presidential run was a spectacular wake-up call, revealing the huge number of Americans willing to fight for radical change. That includes a great many who didn&#x2019;t sign up for the political revolution this time around, which is good news:&nbsp;Our movements can learn how to go even bigger and broader. We can win&#x2015;but only if we continue to develop the kinds of tactics, tools, and vision laid out in this vitally important book, perhaps the first to explore how to organize at the true scale of the crises we face.&#x201d;<strong>--Naomi Klein, author of&nbsp;<em>This Changes Everything&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Shock Doctrine</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Rules for Revolutionaries</em>&nbsp;is a lamppost for those who are committed to causes of community uplift, grassroots empowerment, and organizing for good.

Becky Bond and Zack Exley have walked the walk&#x2015;and they know what organizing looks like when you begin with a big, transformative demand and challenge the establishment. You win big when you ask big&#x2015;and whoever wins in November, we&#x2019;ll need to push for revolutionary change from Day One.

This is Kahf's ultimate message: that religion and ethnicity and color and nationality are as nothing in the face of simple humanity; that spirituality and life are beyond all of these, that no creed or ideology may be taken as justification for harm."--Lisa Suhair Majaj<br> &nbsp;<br> Kahf establishes herself as a new voice in the tradition of ethnic American poets, blending the experiences of recent Arab-American immigrants into contemporary American scenery.&nbsp; In her poems, Muslim ritual and Qur'anic vocabulary move in next door to the idiom of suburban Americana, and the legendary Scheherazad of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>&nbsp;shows up in New Jersey, recast as a sophisticated postcolonial feminist.&nbsp;</p><p>Kahf&#x2019;s carefully crafted poems do not speak only to important issues of ethnicity, gender, and religious diversity in America, but also to universal human themes of family and kinship, friendship, and the search for a place to pray.&nbsp; She chronicles the specific griefs and pleasures of the immigrant and writes an amulet for womanly power in the face of the world&#x2019;s terrors. Her poetic energy is provocative and sassy, punctuated now and then with a darker poem of elegiac sadness or refined rage.</p><p>Mohja Kahf is associate professor of comparative literature at the University of Arkansas.</p><br></p><p>Mohja Kahf is associate professor of comparative literature at the University of Arkansas.Kahf is an earthy, playful, and purposeful poet who writes with as much sass as sensitivity about what it's like to be a woman, a person of color, an immigrant, and a headscarf-wearing Muslim in a non-Muslim country. Born in Damascus, Kahf came to the U.S. as a child, and her empathy is incandescent for all who have had to leave their homes to save their lives and those of their families, and for those whose homes have been destroyed, expressing particular commiseration with besieged Iraqis. Whimsical, colloquial, and disarmingly witty, Kahf conjures a reincarnated Scheherazad "living in Hackensack" and newly divorced so that she's free to pursue her writing. "Words are to die for," after all. Kahf astutely considers the myriad conundrums and frustrations of women's lives in general and Muslim women in particular, and she is brilliantly wry and utterly irresistible in such showstoppers as her poem about a walkout staged by all the chilly and hungry female nudes and odalisques in a Matisse retrospective. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights&#39; Entertainment. The original concept is most likely derived from an ancient Sassanid Persian prototype that relied partly on Indian elements, but the work as we have it was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators and scholars across the Middle East and North Africa. The tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Indian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the Caliphate era, while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hazar Afsan. Though the oldest Arabic manuscript dates from the 14th century, scholarship generally dates the collection&#39;s genesis to around the 9th century.

P. Sanders now offers an expansive introduction to the apostle, navigating some of the thorniest issues in scholarship in language accessible to the novice and seasoned scholar alike. Always careful to distinguish what we can know historically from what we may only conjecture, and these from dogmatically driven misrepresentations, Sanders sketches a fresh picture of the apostle as an ardent defender of his own convictions, ever ready to craft the sorts of arguments that now fill his letters butas Sanders carefully argueswere not the basis for his own beliefs and attitudes. He also gives sustained attention to a historical sketch of Paul's context, particularly Second Temple Judaism, in order to set comparisons of Paul and that context on solid ground. Here are familiar themes from Sanders's earlier workthe importance of works in Paul's thought, the relationship of "plight" and "solution"in a presentation that reveals a career's reflection, along with new thinking regarding development in Paul's thought. All of the letters are carefully introduced in a text that will prove a worthy guide to the student and interested reader.</p><p>E. P. Sanders is the Arts and Sciences Professor of Religion Emeritus at Duke University. He previously taught New Testament studies at McMaster University and at Oxford University as Dean Ireland's Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture and as fellow of The Queen's College.

One of the thrills of listening to Sinatra is wondering how he did it&#x2014;and this book explains it all, bringing the dedicated fan and the casual music lover alike into the recording studio to witness the fascinating working methods he introduced and mastered in his quest for recorded perfection. Revealed is how, in addition to introducing and perfecting a unique vocal style, Sinatra was also his own in-studio producer&#x2014;personally supervising every aspect of his recordings, from choosing the songs and arrangers to making minute adjustments in microphone placement.<br></p><p>ADVANCED PRAISE FOR SESSIONS WITH SINATRA: <p>NANCY SINATRA: </p><p>"My dad's love and respect for music knew no bounds, and could be felt in the intensity of his concentration in the studio.

If you have any sort of passion for the music, this book has all of the answers you probably need to know. Within these pages, Chuck Granata draws on his deep knowledge of both Sinatra's craft and the fine details of the recording process to explain the most important part of Sinatra's legacy: his personal discipline in the recording studio. No recording career has ever been chronicled in quite this way." </p><p>WILL FRIEDWALD, acclaimed author/music critic: </p><p>"'Sessions With Sinatra' is a delight! Frank Sinatra completely changed the course of what Chuck Granata refers to as the 'art' of recording - his book tells how and why. From the cylinder to the CD, and from Thomas Alva Edison to Harry 'Sweets' Edison, it's all told from a Frank-ish perspective in order to illustrate how the century's greatest singer impacted upon the medium. There's no other book like it, and you will learn tons about Sinatra that you never knew before - I know I did." </p><p>SID MARK, WWDB Radio, host of the syndicated 'Sounds of Sinatra' programs: </p><p>"During my forty-plus year association with Mr. Sinatra, I had the pleasure of joining him onstage, backstage - we even lifted one or two.

Such an act signifies death. No wonder North and South Korea always seem so stressed out.This individual had no problem sticking his chopsticks anywhere. In fact, he may have been directly taunting death by risking an intestinal tear or infection by putting these in his receptacle.While the chopsticks in this image are metal, chopsticks are typically made of bamboo or plastic, and, at times, bone, ivory, or wood. An August 2007 article on the <i>China Daily</i> Web site reported that the secretary general of the China Cuisine Association (CCA) said that China produced and disposed of more than 45 billion pairs of wooden chopsticks annually. The secretary general estimated that this practice cost the Chinese environment approximately 25 million trees. We're not sure what percentage of chopsticks is used for the purpose demonstrated in this X-ray, but hopefully those chopsticks are not reused afterward. That would certainly give new meaning to the word, <i>Pu Pu platter</i>.<i><b>Someone Switched This Patient's Usual Cup of Coffee with ...</b></i>We've seen plenty of bottles stuck up patients' rears, but not nearly as many cups, even though they both hold liquids. This is not surprising given the shape of each. Images like the one in the accompanying X-ray naturally make people wonder if a cup can even get all the way up there. Doesn't the object seem much bigger than the pathway?Basic biomechanics provide the answers here. Most skin and mucosa have certain viscoelastic properties, meaning that with enough pressure and time, one can fit surprisingly large objects through a relatively small, yet viscoelastic, space. Now you know how babies are born!Obviously, this property is finite. There is still a limit as to how large an object can ultimately fit without causing a tear or damage. We're not sure what the record is, but we'll continue to keep track of people who try to set it.<i><b>Which Fork Does Etiquette Suggest You Use Here?</b></i>For utensils to be useful for handling food, they must be long and easy to grip. This feature also makes them great for other activities, too. Often, picking the right utensil for a specific use can be a difficult task. For purposes such as this, a knife is obviously too sharp and may cause damage, while a spoon could potentially be too dull and thereby not as stimulating. Goldilocks would have probably made the same choice, assuming she did not have any mental issues after having to run for her life from three talking bears.We think a slightly safer choice would have been a spork, although sporks are often hard to come by as they are typically used only by children, who are far too smart to do this.The more important consideration would be the composition of the silverware. Although worse for the environment, we would hope that people choose plastic, disposable utensils for obvious reasons. Unfortunately, this patient and most others choose stainless steel, probably for the durability and easy handling. Or perhaps they finally found a reason to break out the fine china.Ultimately, you could summarize this case by saying that when this patient reached for a fork, he took it on the road less traveled, and that made all the difference.<i><b>Pain in the Glass</b></i>The comedian Janeane Garofalo once quipped, "I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth." Sadly, the accidental ingestion of small pieces of glass is no laughing matter.One patient, while eating a shrimp and rigatoni dinner at his favorite restaurant, suddenly felt severe pain in his throat, followed later by chest pain. After he completed his meal--yes, <i>after</i>--the patient went to the ER, where the physician discovered glass in the patient's bowels and a perforation of the patient's esophagus. These injuries ultimately healed.The patient asked the restaurant to reimburse him his $200 co-pay for the hospitalization, to which the restaurant agreed. We were surprised by this, considering that when we see physician procedures cause perforations, patients typically ask for far more than their co-pay. In this case, he might have at least also asked for a gift certificate for a free meal ... at another restaurant.<i><b>A Fishy Story</b></i>It's the same old story. A patient once explained that he spent a relaxing day fishing in the ocean. He brought his knife along to cut some bait and clean fish. He than continued the story by saying, "I was fishing, and I must have fallen asleep and rolled around on the ground where the knife was. Next thing I knew, I had this knife in me." Yet another falling asleep fishing and rolling onto a knife story. If you've heard one, you've heard them all.What not everyone has heard of is how dangerous fish can truly be because of all sorts of special bacteria that come with fish. The bacteria can even spread to and infect the brain, which may be the true reason fish is known as brain food.In fact, seafood comes with so many health risks that if we were to review them all it might make you the opposite of a <i>pescatarian,</i> a person who avoids eating most animals but will eat fish.So someone might conclude from the above that if you want to win the fight against a health problem, perhaps you should have lots of cases that scare people. Maybe after this book we will actually see fewer cases of inserted or ingested foreign bodies ... though knowing human nature, quite possibly not.<i><b>Just Beat It</b></i>This patient's reasons were obvious. Beaters work by really being able to get into and penetrate whatever they are mixing. The multiple prongs maximize what the beater can grab. With all this penetrating and grabbing, getting this beater off--<i>oops,</i> we mean, <i>out</i>--was challenging. We had to get the patient to use his sensations to direct our movements to get the beater out, as offbeat as that sounds.Using beaters properly is particularly important when cooking a souffl�. A souffl� is composed of stiffly beaten egg whites that are folded into a sweet or savory base. You may have heard the classic lore that by opening or closing the door of the oven the souffl� may fall. This demise actually happens due to a quick change in temperature from opening and closing the door to the oven. Any grease or dirt on the cooking utensils can prevent the egg whites from rising and also lead to collapse. Therefore, upon removal, the beater in this X-ray should not be used to make a souffl�.<i><b>Some Sneezes May Require More Than a "Bless You"</b></i>We have peppered this vignette with all sorts of facts. Wikipedia states that black peppercorns were found stuffed in the nostrils of the Pharaoh Ramesses II, ruler of Egypt, who died more than 3,000 years ago. More recently, a pepper shaker, presumably full of ground peppercorns, was found stuffed in the rectum of this individual. This patient's medical records do not comment on whether his act was a modern interpretation of the ancient mummification ritual or whether he had heard that in ancient India, where black pepper is thought to have originated, it was used to treat conditions such as constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, cough, and nasal congestion. Using pepper to decrease nasal congestion seems as intelligent as eating spicy Indian food to decrease diarrhea.So for those who may be tempted to follow this example, let us consider that if black pepper makes people sneeze when it's inhaled, just imagine the effect down below.<i><b>The Pepsi Challenge</b></i>This type of bottle is made of hygroscopic material, which has the ability to absorb water, like the colon. Approximately 97 out of 100 physicians recommend allowing the colon to function on its own, without the aid of a bottle. The three others replied, "No comment."Patients who suffer from the problem of having a bottle stuck up their rear are often not honest about what happened. Here are some examples:PATIENT A: Doc, I was vacuuming in the nude, and I fell. It was a million-to-one shot, Doc, a million-to-one.PATIENT B: My hands were full.PATIENT C: I swore this would never happen again. This time I made sure to put a string in the bottle and closed the cap. When I pulled the string, there was nothing on the other end.Note the angle at which this bottle is inserted, near the prostate. An article published in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> in 1985 indicated that major colas might affect sperm motility. Perhaps this patient was trying to figure this out for himself.<i><b>So Would It Taste Salty?</b></i>Doctors often recommend that patients reduce their daily sodium intake. One patient clearly did not heed those warnings.Table salt is traditionally made of the compound sodium chloride. One of the most common forms of high blood pressure can be affected by salt intake. This patient had more than high blood pressure to worry about, though, which probably raised his blood pressure even more.Salt can have some benefits. In America, salt contains iodine. If you do not have iodine, your brain sends hormonal messages to the thyroid that may cause it to grow larger and develop a goiter in an attempt to make more thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland can grow so large that it can wrap around the throat and extend down into the chest. If it could extend down a little further perhaps it could push out the salt.If your doctor tell...</p><h2>The Secret History of Nursery Rhymes</h2><p>Many nursery rhymes are believed to be associated with actual events in history, and include references to murder, torture, betrayal, greed, and to tyrants and royalty. Reciting them to our children is an enjoyable first step to developing their language skills, the words passed from one generation to the next but the secret histories behind them are long forgotten . . . until now. This book uncovers the Secret History of Nursery Rhymes. Many of the history and origins of the humble nursery rhyme are believed to be associated with actual events in history, with references to murder and persecution, betrayal, greed and to tyrants and royalty. Rhymes are usually short and therefore easy to remember, a critical factor during the times when many people were unable to read or write. They were passed verbally from one generation to the next before the invention of the printing press. Reciting old Nursery Rhymes to our children is one of the most pleasurable first steps to developing their language skills and extending their vocabulary. The words were remembered but their secret histories were forgotten. Political satire was cleverly disguised in the wording of some, seemingly innocent, nursery rhymes. These were used as safe vehicles to parody unpopular political, royal and historical events of the day. By this simple process, subversive messages of discontent were spread in times when words of dissent, or the direct criticism of powerful people, would often have been punishable by torture or death. Although some of the most popular Nursery Rhymes are rooted in English history they are told to children throughout the English-speaking world. Old English Nursery Rhymes were taken to America with the settlers from England. They were then spread across Commonwealth countries including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 96 pages, black and white images throughout.</p><p></p><h2>Flirt!

This is the story of a man who, like Nat Turner, Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X, is a complex yet seminal hero in the history of African American emancipation.<br><br>Denmark Vesey was a charasmatic ex-slave--literate, professional, and relatively well-off--who had purchased his own freedom with the winnings from a lottery. Inspired by the success of the revolutionary black republic in Haiti, he persuaded some nine thousand slaves to join him in a revolt. On a June evening in 1822, having gathered guns, and daggers, they were to converge on Charleston, South Carolina, take the city's arsenal, murder the populace, burn the city, and escape by ship to Haiti or Africa. When the uprising was betrayed, Vesey and seventy-seven of his followers were executed, the matter hushed by Charleston's elite for fear of further rebellion. Compelling, informative, and often disturbing, this book is essential to a fuller understanding of the struggle against slavery.</p><p>In 1822, Denmark Vesey, a Caribbean-born free Negro from Charleston, South Carolina, led the largest attempted slave revolt in U.S. history with over 9,000 blacks. Although it failed--thanks to the confessions of a house slave to his master--and Vesey was executed, his heroic attempt continues to be a source of pride for African Americans. David Robertson's well-researched book chronicles Vesey's life as a slave in Haiti, his move to Charleston, his fluency in English, Creole, and French, and his skillful use of Christian teachings (and possibly Islamic ones, as well) to inspire the slaves to rebel. "He was a black man of great physical presence, strength, and intellect," Robertson writes, "linguistically fluent and politically facile enough to mold various African ethnic and religious groups into one unified force." Using court testimony from Vesey's trial and historical archives, Robertson unveils the stark and violent climate of antebellum life in 18th-century America, bringing to life a hero who fought for the same principles upon which the democratic nation in which he was made a slave was founded. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>"A fascinating historical detective story . . . Robertson deftly teases out tantalizing clues without pushing his speculation too far . . . [His] thoughtful chronicle restores to the record a powerful figure whose story continues to challenge America's vision of itself as a place of equality and harmony."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"This book is truly something new . . . Robertson is a dogged seeker of truth with a fertile imagination . . . He disinters the secret of those who needed to bury Vesey's outrage and thereby deflect the light from their outrageous treatment of people they made slaves." --<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Robertson's well-researched narrative and smooth style make this an intelligent analysis of, as well as a worthy tribute to, his subject." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Compelling... A fascinating narrative."--<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Excellent.

What if the Reformers really were heroes, the Bible the sole rule of faith, and Christ s Church just an invisible collection of loosely united believers? As an Evangelical, Devin Rose used to believe all of it. Then one day the nagging questions began. He noticed things about Protestant belief and practice that didn t add up. He began following the logic of Protestant claims to places he never expected it to go -leading to conclusions no Christians would ever admit to holding. In The Protestant s Dilemma, Rose examines over thirty of those conclusions, showing with solid evidence, compelling reason, and gentle humor how the major tenets of Protestantism - if honestly pursued to their furthest extent - wind up in dead ends. The only escape? Catholic truth. Rose patiently unpacks each instance, and shows how Catholicism solves the Protestant s dilemma through the witness of Scripture, Christian history, and the authority with which Christ himself undeniably vested his Church. The Protestant s Dilemma is the perfect book for non-Catholics trying to work through their own nagging doubts, or for Catholics looking for a fresh way to deepen their understanding of the Faith</p><p>Devin Rose is a Catholic husband and father. By day he&#39;s a software developer, and by night, after tucking the children into bed, he&#39;s a lay apologist. He has appeared on EWTN radio and written articles for numerous Catholic websites.The Protestant s Dilemma is different from other books written by Catholic converts. Devin Rose takes his reader on a dialectical journey, showing that the beliefs we share with our Protestant friends are only authoritative on ecclesiastical grounds that our Protestant friends reject. Working within the tradition of Socratic reasoning, Rose provides a compelling case for the Catholic Faith. --Francis J. Beckwith, Professor of Philosophy &amp; Church-State Studies, and Co-Director of the Program in Philosophical Studies of Religion, Baylor University<br><br>When as a Protestant I began to explore Catholicism, I Googled, Why become Catholic? What I was really searching for was a book like The Protestant s Dilemma. This book pokes, prods, and wrestles with Protestant beliefs, showing how they come up short and how the Catholic alternatives are true. If you struggle with the claims of Protestantism or even if you feel satisfied with them! The Protestant s Dilemma will open your eyes to the rich, logical, biblical claims of the Catholic Church. --Brandon Vogt, Word on Fire Catholic Ministries<br><br>As a former Protestant pastor, I wish that I had read a book like this! Devin Rose serves as a theological tour guide, leading the Protestant from the parlor of Martin Luther to the high altar of St. Peter s Basilica. Along the way, he demonstrates that each and every step toward the Catholic Church conforms to Sacred Scripture and Church history. This is the guidebook to get you from the Reformation to Rome. --Taylor Marshall, author of The Crucified Rabbi: Judaism &amp; the Origins of Catholicism</p><h2>A Short Philosophy of Birds</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Brilliant, magical and engrossing&#x2013;I will never see birds the same way again.&#x201d;</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<strong>Peter Wohlleben, author of <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong>THE INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON</strong></p><p><strong>Twenty-two short lessons from the secret lives of birds on living harmoniously and reconnecting with nature.</strong><br><br>This charming volume on bird behavior invites us to take a step back from our busy lives and to listen to the tiny philosophers of the sky.

But what about a biblical cosmos view? From the beginning of Genesis we encounter a vaulted dome above the earth, a "firmament," like the ceiling of a planetarium. Elsewhere we read of the earth sitting on pillars. What does the dome of heaven have to do with deep space? Even when the biblical language is clearly poetic, it seems to be funded by a very different understanding of how the cosmos is put together. As Kyle Greenwood shows, the language of the Bible is also that of the ancient Near Eastern palace, temple and hearth. There was no other way of thinking or speaking of earth and sky or the sun, moon and stars. But when the psalmist looked at the heavens, the delicate fingerwork of God, it evoked wonder. Even today it is astronomy and cosmology that invoke our awe and point toward the depths of divine mystery. Greenwood helps us see how the best Christian thinkers have viewed the cosmos in light of Scripture&#x2015;and grappled with new understandings as science has advanced from Aristotle to Copernicus to Galileo and the galaxies of deep space. It's a compelling story that both illuminates the text of Scripture and helps us find our own place in the tradition of faithful Christian thinking and interpretation.</p><p>Kyle Greenwood (PhD, Hebrew Union College) is associate professor of Old Testament and Hebrew language at Colorado Christian University. He is the author of several studies of the Old Testament in its ancient Near Eastern environment."While, therefore, some readers may not agree with certain arguments or conclusions set forth in this work, Greenwood is nevertheless to be thanked for engaging and contributing to the issue in an exemplary thoughtful and irenic fashion. Also laudable is that the book is written with a high view of Scripture, reverently concerned that more care be taken to discern what the Scriptures actually teach and do not teach--lest faulty science be asserted which brings Scripture into ill repute, while straining the faith of the less-seasoned among God's people. Greenwood's tone is winsome and pastoral; rather than writing to refute the Bible's gainsayers, he has endeavored to help the challenged believer." - L. Michael Morales,&nbsp;<i>Themelios&nbsp;</i><br><br>"<i>Scripture and Cosmology</i> is a welcome addition to the discussion [for how science and Scripture can coexist] that will prove engaging in both popular and academic contexts." - Eric J.

Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word." After more than five years, the Lord brought it to a conclusion, directing her to establish her own ministry and call it "Life In The Word, Inc." <p>Now, her Life In The Word radio and television broadcasts are seen and heard by millions across the United States and throughout the world. Joyce's teaching tapes are enjoyed internationally, and she travels extensively conducting Life In The Word conferences. </p><p>Joyce and her husband, Dave, the business administrator at Life In The Word, have been married for over 35 years. They reside in St. Louis, Missouri, and are the parents of four children. All four children are married and, along with their spouses, work with Dave and Joyce in the ministry. </p><p>Believing the call on her life is to establish believers in God's Word, Joyce says, "Jesus died to set the captives free, and far too many Christians have little or no victory in their daily lives." Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory. Her life is transparent, and her teachings are practical and can be applied in everyday life. </p><p>Joyce has taught on emotional healing and related subjects in meetings all over the country, helping multiplied thousands. She has recorded more than 230 different audio-cassette albums and over 75 videos. She has also authored 49 books to help the body of Christ on various topics.</p></p><h2>Tattered and Mended: The Art of Healing the Wounded Soul</h2><p>For years, society and especially the church required that we hide our brokenness and pretend that all was well, even when it was terribly broken. Now, people have become comfortable with our tattered edges, our character weaknesses, our &#x201c;old, familiar sins,&#x201d; and forgotten that God doesn&#x2019;t intend to leave us in a state of disrepair. God calls us to something other than the wild pendulum swing from hiding our scars to flaunting them. Rather than resigning ourselves to desperately clinging to shreds of recovery, or discarding the broken, threadbare, scarred relationships, we can engage in the process of healing through Christ. Jesus reclaims what we fear was damaged beyond repair. His soul-mend leaves hope where the wound once was. And, as we engage in the process of healing, we grow in appreciation of how God tends and transforms our wounds.</p><p><strong>Cynthia Rucht</strong><strong>i</strong> tells stories <em>hemmed in hope</em>.

This unique approach to the subject will introduce you to a trio of new thieves: group vampires, parasitic vampires, and global vampirism.</p> <p>Exploring environmental, developmental, and past-life factors, <em>Psychic Vampires</em> presents effective step-by-step empowerment procedures you can use to protect yourself and replenish your energy reserves.

But Joe H. Slate, an academic researcher and practicing psychologist, has written an earnest discussion on a lesser-known form of vampirism: predators who feed off human energy rather than blood. Every psychic-vampire attack "consumes its victim's energy and over the long haul destroys the energy system itself," he writes. Victims of repeated vampire attacks may experience "chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances ... excessive anxiety, sexual indifference, and impaired memory." Much of Slate's book speaks to warding off these toxic energy attacks. (These psychic attacks take many forms: one-on-one conversations, a touch on the shoulder, or even a long-distance thought assault.) The best defense is a "strong internal system," claims Slate, who suggests numerous exercises and tools for boosting personal energy. Despite the havoc they wreak, most of Slate's vampires are not portrayed as evil life suckers, but rather people caught in a debilitating cycle of energy addiction. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Joe H.

Just mention IQ testing in polite company, and you'll sternly be informed that IQ tests don't measure anything "real", and only reflect how good you are at doing IQ tests; that they ignore important traits like "emotional intelligence" and "multiple intelligences"; and that those who are interested in IQ testing must be elitists, or maybe something more sinister.<br> <br>Yet the scientific evidence is clear: IQ tests are extraordinarily useful. IQ scores are related to a huge variety of important life outcomes like educational success, income, and even life expectancy, and biological studies have shown they are genetically influenced and linked to measures of the brain. Studies of intelligence and IQ are regularly published in the world's top scientific journals.<br> <br>This book will offer an entertaining introduction to the state of the art in intelligence and IQ, and will show how we have arrived at what we know from a century's research. It will engage head-on with many of the criticisms of IQ testing by describing the latest high-quality scientific research, but will not be a simple point-by-point rebuttal: it will make a positive case for IQ research, focusing on the potential benefits for society that a better understanding of intelligence can bring.</p><p>Dr. Stuart J.

It was an influential example of the revival of interest in esoteric and occult ideas in the modern age, in particular because of its claim to reconcile ancient eastern wisdom with modern science.<br><br>Blavatsky claimed that its contents had been revealed to her by 'mahatmas' who had retained knowledge of mankind's spiritual history, knowledge that it was now possible, in part, to reveal.<br><br>The first part of the book explained the origins of the universe itself, in terms derived from the Hindu concept of Yugas, or long passages of time through which the world is supposed to have evolved. Blavatsky attempted to demonstrate that the discoveries of "materialist" science had been anticipated in the writings of ancient sages, and that materialism would soon be proven wrong. <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i><br><br><b>About the Author</b><br><br>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831 - 1891)<br>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky was born on August 12, 1831, at Dnepropetrovsk (Ekaterinoslav), Ukraine, daughter of Colonel Peter Alexeyevich von Hahn and novelist Helena Andreyevna.

O'Donnell</b> is the award-winning author of six books, including the highly acclaimed account of the Battle of Fallujah, <i>We Were One</i>. He lives in Arlington, Virginia.Revisiting one of the most dangerous WWII missions ever, O'Donnell (<i>We Were One</i>) examines the planning and execution of a 1944 strike by Jewish soldiers against a top-secret target in Austria that, it was believed, could shorten the conflict. He fleshes out the tale of sacrifice, spies, courage and betrayal organized by the American Office of Strategic Services to take on Gestapo troops in a heavily fortified district, Alpine Redoubt, the site of a planned bunker where Nazi leaders would hide after the Allies arrived in Germany. Under the command of Frederick Mayer&#x2014;a German-Jewish refugee, naturalized American citizen and Wildcat Ranger&#x2014;Operation Greenup was a brazen military exercise behind enemy lines, using a core of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and locals to gather intelligence and reduce the resistance from SS soldiers. Armed with research in the National Archives, confidential documents and personal interviews, O'Donnell tells a heart-stopping tale of sabotage by men and women who placed everything on the line against a seemingly unstoppable tyranny. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos; map. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I learned that spirits dwelled in plants, and that to invoke them, one simply inhaled the scent of the flowers and called their names. She taught me to call the fairy folk by pouring milk, wine, and honey into a bowl and setting it under a myrtle bush. Once the bowl was in place, a reed tied to a string was swung briskly overhead in a clockwise circle, and we would whistle a slow, haunting melody. The rustling of the leaves was a sign that the fairies had come. But all of this was secret, and secrecy surrounded everything I was taught."</p><p>These were the Old Ways, part of a legacy of magick passed down through family lines, and kept alive for centuries. The secret ways of Italian witches live on today, and serve as an excellent model for any tradition of magick that seeks to impart its wisdom to future generations. In this well-crafted book, respected author Raven Grimassi tells the story of his family's traditions, from ritual spellwork to the Italian tooth fairy. Engaging and thought-provoking, Hereditary Witchcraft inspires us all to preserve the sacredness of our mysteries and magicks by giving them away -- as gifts to our children.</p></p><h2>The Perfect Nanny: A Novel</h2><p><b><b><b>One of the 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>*National Bestseller*</b><br><br>&#x201c;</b>You won't move until you reach the last page.<b>&#x201d;</b>&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;People</i><br><br><i>She has the keys to their apartment. She knows everything. She has embedded herself so deeply in their lives that it now seems impossible to remove her.</i><br></b>&nbsp;<br>When Myriam decides to return to work as a lawyer after having children, she and her husband look for the perfect nanny for their son and daughter. They never dreamed they would find Louise: a quiet, polite, devoted woman who sings to the children, cleans the family&#x2019;s chic Paris apartment, stays late without complaint, and hosts enviable kiddie parties. But as the couple and the nanny become more dependent on one another, jealousy, resentment, and suspicions mount, shattering the idyllic tableau. Building tension with every page,&nbsp;<i>The Perfect Nanny&nbsp;</i>is a compulsive, riveting, bravely observed exploration of power, class, race, domesticity, motherhood, and madness&#x2014;and the American debut of an immensely talented writer.</p><p><b>Leila Slimani</b> is the first Moroccan woman to win France&#x2019;s most prestigious literary prize, the Goncourt, which she won for <i>The Perfect Nanny</i>. Her first novel, <i>Ad�le</i>, won the La Mamounia Prize for the best book by a Moroccan author written in French. A journalist and frequent commentator on women&#x2019;s and human rights, Slimani is French president Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s personal representative for the promotion of the French language and culture and was ranked #2 on <i>Vanity Fair</i> France&#x2019;s annual list of The Fifty Most Influential French People in the World. Born in Rabat, Morocco, in 1981, she now lives in Paris with her French husband and their two young children.&#x201c;My nanny is a miracle-worker.&#x201d; That is what Myriam says when she describes Louise&#x2019;s sudden entrance into their lives. She must have magical powers to have trans�formed this stifling, cramped apartment into a calm, light- filled place. Louise has pushed back the walls. She has made the cupboards deeper, the drawers wider. She has let the sun in.&nbsp;<br><br> On the first day, Myriam gives her a few instructions. She shows her how the appliances work. Pointing to an object or a piece of clothing, she repeats: &#x201c;Be careful with that. I&#x2019;m very attached to it.&#x201d; She makes recommendations about Paul&#x2019;s vinyl collection, which the children must not touch. Louise nods, silent and docile. She observes each room with the self-assurance of a general standing before a territory he is about to conquer. <br><br> In the weeks that follow her arrival, Louise turns this hasty sketch of an apartment into an ideal bourgeois inte�rior. She imposes her old-fashioned manners, her taste for perfection. Myriam and Paul can&#x2019;t get over it. She sews the buttons back on to jackets that they haven&#x2019;t worn for months because they&#x2019;ve been too lazy to look for a needle. She hems skirts and pairs of trousers. She mends Mila&#x2019;s clothes, which Myriam was about to throw out without a qualm. Louise washes the curtains yellowed by tobacco and dust. Once a week, she changes the sheets. Paul and Myriam are overjoyed. Paul tells her with a smile that she is like Mary Poppins. He isn&#x2019;t sure she understands the compliment. <br><br> At night, in the comfort of their clean sheets, the cou�ple laughs, incredulous at their new life. They feel as if they have found a rare pearl, as if they&#x2019;ve been blessed. Of course, Louise&#x2019;s wages are a burden on the family budget, but Paul no longer complains about that. In a few weeks, Louise&#x2019;s presence has become indispensable.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br> When Myriam gets back from work in the evenings, she finds dinner ready. The children are calm and clean, not a hair out of place. Louise arouses and fulfills the fantasies of an idyllic family life that Myriam guiltily nurses. She teaches Mila to tidy up behind herself and her parents watch dumbstruck as the little girl hangs her coat on the peg. <br><br> Useless objects have disappeared. With Louise, noth�ing accumulates anymore: no dirty dishes, no dirty laun�dry, no unopened envelopes found later under an old magazine. Nothing rots, nothing expires. Louise never ne�glects anything. Louise is scrupulous. She writes every�thing down in a little flower-covered notebook. The times of the dance class, school outings, doctor&#x2019;s appointments. She copies the names of the medicines the children take, the price of the ice creams she bought for them at the fairground, and the exact words that Mila&#x2019;s schoolteacher said to her. <br><br> After a few weeks, she no longer hesitates to move ob�jects around. She empties the cupboards completely, hangs little bags of lavender between the coats. She makes bouquets of flowers. She feels a serene contentment when&#x2014;with Adam asleep and Mila at school&#x2014; she can sit down and contemplate her task. The silent apartment is completely under her power, like an enemy begging for forgiveness. <br><br> But it&#x2019;s in the kitchen that she accomplishes the most extraordinary wonders. Myriam has admitted to her that she doesn&#x2019;t know how to cook anything and doesn&#x2019;t really want to learn. The nanny prepares meals that Paul goes into raptures about and the children devour, without a word and without anyone having to order them to finish their plate. Myriam and Paul start inviting friends again, and they are fed on <i>blanquette de veau</i>, <i>pot-au-feu</i>, ham hock with sage and delicious vegetables, all lovingly cooked by Louise. They congratulate Myriam, shower her with compliments, but she always admits: &#x201c;My nanny did it all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Mila is at school, Louise attaches Adam to her in a large wrap. She likes to feel the child&#x2019;s chubby thighs against her belly, his saliva that runs down her neck when he falls asleep. She sings all day for this baby, praising him for his laziness. She massages him, taking pride in his folds of flesh, his round pink cheeks. In the mornings, the child welcomes her with gurgles, his plump arms reaching out for her. In the weeks that follow Louise&#x2019;s arrival, Adam learns to walk. And this boy who used to cry every night sleeps peacefully until morning. <br><br> Mila is wilder. She is a small, fragile girl with the pos�ture of a ballerina. Louise ties her hair in buns so tight that the girl&#x2019;s eyes look slanted, pulled toward her tem�ples. Like that, she resembles one of those medieval hero�ines with a broad forehead, a cold and noble expression. Mila is a difficult, exhausting child. Any time she becomes irritated, she screams. She throws herself to the ground in the middle of the street, stamps her feet, lets herself be dragged along to humiliate Louise. When the nanny crouches down and tries to speak to her, Mila turns away. <br><br> She counts out loud the butterflies on the wallpaper. She watches herself in the mirror when she cries. This child is obsessed by her own reflection. In the street, her eyes are riveted to shop windows. On several occasions she has bumped into lampposts or tripped over small obstacles on the sidewalk, distracted by the contemplation of her own image. <br><br> Mila is cunning. She knows that crowds stare, and that Louise feels ashamed in the street. The nanny gives in more quickly when they are in public. Louise has to take detours to avoid the toyshop on the avenue, where the lit�tle girl stands in front of the window and screams. On the way to school, Mila drags her feet. She steals a raspberry from a greengrocer&#x2019;s stall. She climbs on to windowsills, hides in porches, and runs away as fast as her legs will carry her. Louise tries to go after her while pushing the stroller, yelling the girl&#x2019;s name, but Mila doesn&#x2019;t stop until she comes to the very end of the sidewalk. Sometimes Mila regrets her bad behavior. She worries about Louise&#x2019;s paleness and the frights she gives her. She becomes loving again, cuddly. She makes it up to the nanny, clinging to her legs. She cries and wants to be mothered. <br><br> Slowly, Louise tames the child. Day after day, she tells her stories, where the same characters always recur. Or�phans, lost little girls, princesses kept as prisoners, and castles abandoned by terrible ogres. Strange beasts&#x2014;birds with twisted beaks, one-legged bears and melancholic unicorns&#x2014;populate Louise&#x2019;s landscapes. The little girl falls silent. She stays close to the nanny, attentive, impatient. She asks for certain characters to come back. Where do these stories come from? They emanate from Louise, in a continual flood, without her even thinking about it, with�out her making the slightest effort of memory or imagina�tion. But in what black lake, in what deep forest has she found these cruel tales where the heroes die at the end, after first saving the world?</p><h2>The Spark: A Mother&#39;s Story of Nurturing, Genius, and Autism</h2><p>Kristine Barnett&#x2019;s son Jacob has an IQ higher than Einstein&#x2019;s, a photographic memory, and he taught himself calculus in two weeks. At nine he started working on an original theory in astrophysics that experts believe may someday put him in line for a Nobel Prize, and at age twelve he became a paid researcher in quantum physics. But the story of Kristine&#x2019;s journey with Jake is all the more remarkable because his extraordinary mind was almost lost to autism. At age two, when Jake was diagnosed, Kristine was told he might never be able to tie his own shoes.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>The Spark</i> is a remarkable memoir of mother and son. Surrounded by &#x201c;experts&#x201d; at home and in special ed who tried to focus on Jake&#x2019;s most basic skills and curtail his distracting interests&#x2014;moving shadows on the wall, stars, plaid patterns on sofa fabric&#x2014;Jake made no progress, withdrew more and more into his own world, and eventually stopped talking completely. Kristine knew in her heart that she had to make a change. Against the advice of her husband, Michael, and the developmental specialists, Kristine followed her instincts, pulled Jake out of special ed, and began preparing him for mainstream kindergarten on her own.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relying on the insights she developed at the daycare center she runs out of the garage in her home, Kristine resolved to follow Jacob&#x2019;s &#x201c;spark&#x201d;&#x2014;his passionate interests. Why concentrate on what he couldn&#x2019;t do? Why not focus on what he could?&nbsp; This basic philosophy, along with her belief in the power of ordinary childhood experiences (softball, picnics, s&#x2019;mores around the campfire) and the importance of play, helped Kristine overcome huge odds.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Barnetts were not wealthy people, and in addition to financial hardship, Kristine herself faced serious health issues. But through hard work and determination on behalf of Jake and his two younger brothers, as well as an undying faith in their community, friends, and family, Kristine and Michael prevailed. The results were beyond anything anyone could have imagined.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dramatic, inspiring, and transformative, <i>The Spark </i>is about the power of love and courage in the face of overwhelming obstacles, and the dazzling possibilities that can occur when we learn how to tap the true potential that lies within every child, and in all of us.<br><br><b>Praise for<i> The Spark</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;[An] amazing memoir . . . compulsive reading.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;<i>The Spark</i> is about the transformative power of unconditional love.

She is a public speaker on alternative education for children with autism.An Inch, or Ten Thousand Miles<br><br>November 2001<br><br>JAKE, AGE THREE<br><br>"Mrs. Barnett, I'd like to talk to you about the alphabet cards you've been sending to school with Jacob."<br><br>Jake and I were sitting with his special ed teacher in our living room during her monthly, state-mandated visit to our home. He loved those brightly colored flash cards more than anything in the world, as attached to them as other children were to love-worn teddy bears or threadbare security blankets. The cards were sold at the front of the SuperTarget where I did my shopping. Other children snuck boxes of cereal or candy bars into their mothers' shopping carts, while the only items that ever mysteriously appeared in mine were yet more packs of Jake's favorite alphabet cards.<br><br>"Oh, I don't send the cards; Jake grabs them on his way out the door. I have to pry them out of his hands to get his shirt on. He even takes them to bed with him!"<br><br>Jake's teacher shifted uncomfortably on the couch. "I wonder if you might need to adjust your expectations for Jacob, Mrs. Barnett. Ours is a life skills program. We're focusing on things like helping him learn to get dressed by himself someday." Her voice was gentle, but she was determined to be clear.<br><br>"Oh, of course, I know that. We're working on those skills at home, too. But he just loves his cards . . ."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Barnett. What I'm saying is that we don't think you're going to need to worry about the alphabet with Jacob."<br><br>Finally--finally--I understood what my son's teacher had been trying to tell me. She wanted to protect me, to make sure I was clear on the objectives of a life skills program. She wasn't saying that alphabet flash cards were premature. She was saying we wouldn't ever have to worry about the alphabet with Jake, because they didn't think he'd ever read.<br><br>It was a devastating moment, in a year that had been full of them. Jake had recently been diagnosed with autism, and I had finally come to understand that all bets were off as to when (or whether) Jake would reach any of the normal childhood developmental milestones. I had spent nearly a year stepping forward to meet the gaping, gray uncertainty of autism. I had stood by helplessly watching as many of Jake's abilities, such as reading and talking, had disappeared. But I was not going to let anyone slam the door shut on the potential of this child at the tender age of three, whether he was autistic or not.<br><br>Ironically, I wasn't hopeful that Jake would ever read, but neither was I prepared to let anyone set a ceiling for what we could expect from him, especially one so low. That morning, it felt as if Jake's teacher had slammed a door on his future.<br><br>For a parent, it's terrifying to fly against the advice of the professionals, but I knew in my heart that if Jake stayed in special ed, he would slip away. So I decided to trust my instincts and embrace hope instead of abandoning it. I wouldn't spend any time or energy fighting to convince the teachers and therapists at his school to change their expectations or their methods. I didn't want to struggle against the system or impose what I felt was right for Jake on others. Rather than hiring lawyers and experts and advocates to get Jake the services he needed, I would invest directly in Jake and do whatever I felt was necessary to help him reach his full potential--whatever that might be.<br><br>As a result, I made the scariest decision of my life. It meant going against the experts and even my husband, Michael. That day, I resolved to stoke Jake's passion. Maybe he was trying to learn to read with those beloved alphabet cards, maybe he wasn't. Either way, instead of taking them away, I would make sure he had as many as he wanted.<br><br>Three years before, I'd been ecstatic to find out I was pregnant with Jake. At twenty-four, I'd been practicing for the role of mother as far back as I could remember.<br><br>Even as a little girl, it was clear to me (and to everyone around me) that children were likely to hold a special place in my future. My family had always called me the Pied Piper, because wherever I went, there was sure to be a trail of little ones on my heels, waiting for an adventure to begin. My brother, Benjamin, was born when I was eleven, and right from the start he was never far from my hip. By the time I was thirteen, I was the go-to babysitter for the whole neighborhood, and by fourteen I was in charge of the Sunday school at our church. So nobody was the least bit surprised when I went to work as a live-in nanny to help pay my way through college. Then, after I got married, I opened my own daycare, a lifelong dream. I'd been around children my whole life, and now I couldn't wait to have my own.<br><br>Unfortunately, the road leading to Jake's birth was not easy. Although I was still young, the pregnancy was touch and go from the beginning. I developed a dangerous high-blood-pressure condition called preeclampsia, which is common in pregnancy and can harm both mother and child. My mother helped out with my daycare, as I was desperate to hold on to the baby. But the pregnancy became more and more fraught, as I went into preterm labor again and again. Eventually, my doctors became so concerned that they put me on medication and strict bed rest to help prevent premature labor. Even so, I was hospitalized nine times.<br><br>Three weeks before my due date, I was rushed to the hospital once again, this time in labor that couldn't be reversed. A cascade of events made the outcome increasingly uncertain. For me, the scene was a kaleidoscope of people rushing in and out, alarms sounding constantly, as the faces of the nurses and doctors crowding the room grew increasingly tense. Michael says this was the day he saw exactly how tough and stubborn I could be. I didn't know it at the time, but my doctor had pulled him aside to tell him that labor wasn't going well and he needed to be prepared: It was likely he would be going home with either a wife or a baby, but not both.<br><br>All I knew was that in the middle of the hazy blur of noise, pain, medication, and fear, suddenly Michael was by my side, holding my hand and looking into my eyes. He was a tractor beam, pulling my -attention--my whole being--into focus. That moment is the only clear memory I have of that frantic time. I felt as if a camera had zoomed in on us and all the commotion surrounding us had ceased. For me, there was only Michael, fiercely strong and absolutely determined that I hear him.<br><br>"There aren't just two but three lives at stake here, Kris. We're going to get through this together. We have to."<br><br>I don't know whether it was the actual words he said or the look in his eyes, but his urgent message broke through the fog of my terror and pain. He willed me to understand the unending depth of his love for me and to draw strength from it. He seemed so certain that it was in my power to choose life that he made it true. And in a way that felt sacred, he promised in return to be a never-ending source of strength and happiness for me and for our child for the rest of his days. He was like the captain of a ship in a terrible storm, commanding me to focus and to survive. And I did.<br><br>Real or imagined, I also heard him promise me fresh flowers in our home every day for the rest of my life. Michael knew that I had always been wild for flowers, but a bouquet from a florist was a luxury we could afford on only the most special occasions. Nevertheless, the next day, while I held our beautiful baby boy in my arms, Michael presented me with the most beautiful roses I have ever seen in my life. Thirteen years have passed since that day, and fresh flowers have arrived for me every week, no matter what.<br><br>We were the lucky ones--the happy miracle. We couldn't know it then, but this would not be the last time our family would be tested or that we would beat incredible odds. Outside of romance novels perhaps, people don't talk seriously about the kind of love that makes anything possible. But Michael and I have that kind of love. Even when we don't agree, that love is our mooring in rough waters. I know in my heart it was the power of Michael's love that pulled Jake and me through the day Jake was born, and it has made everything that has happened since then possible.<br><br>When we left the hospital, Michael and I had everything we'd ever wanted. I'm sure every new family feels that way, but we truly felt that we were the most fortunate people on the planet.<br><br>On the way home, with our brand-new bundle in tow, we stopped to sign the final mortgage papers on our first home. With a little help from my larger-than-life grandfather Grandpa John Henry, we were moving into a modest house at the end of a cul-de-sac in a working-class suburb in Indiana, where I also would operate my daycare business.<br><br>Glancing over Jake's fuzzy newborn head at a beaming Michael, I was suddenly reminded that it was pure serendipity that Michael and I had found each other--especially when our first meeting seemed so ill-fated.<br><br>Michael and I met while we were in college. Our seeming "chance encounter" was actually the ploy of my meddling sister, Stephanie. Completely unbeknownst to me, she had felt compelled to play matchmaker--a ludicrous notion, since I was emphatically not in the market for a beau. On the contrary, I was on the giddy cusp of becoming officially engaged--I hoped--to a wonderful young man named Rick, my very own Prince Charming. We were blissful together, and I was looking forward to our happily ever after.<br><br>Stephanie, however, had a "feeling" about me and a boy from her public-speaking class--a boy who was not just brilliant but electrifying, a boy she was convinced was my true soul mate. So she hatched a scheme.<br><br>On the afternoon she sprung her trap, I was busy in her powder room, readying myself for a date with Rick, with at least twenty different shades of lipstick and eight pairs of shoes out for consideration. When I finally emerged, I found that the person standing before me was not my boyfriend, but a boy I'd never laid eyes on before. There, in her tiny studio apartment, under false pretenses, Stephanie introduced me to Michael Barnett.<br><br>Confused by this unexpected visitor, I looked to my sister for an explanation. She pulled me aside to confide in a hushed whisper things that made no sense at all. She said that she'd invited this boy over so that we'd be forced to meet. She'd even called my boyfriend with an excuse to cancel our date that evening.<br><br>At first I was too dumbstruck to react. As it slowly dawned on me that Stephanie was trying to play Cupid, I truly thought she'd lost her mind. Who fixes up someone who's hoping her boyfriend is about to propose?<br><br>I was furious. She and I hadn't been raised to play the field. In fact, I hadn't gone on my first date until I was in college. We certainly hadn't been taught to be dishonest or disloyal either. What could she have been thinking? But as much as I felt like screaming at her--or storming out of the apartment altogether--we'd been raised with good manners, and Stephanie was counting on that.<br><br>I extended my hand to the boy, who was as much a pawn in Stephanie's charade as I, and took a seat with him and my sister in the living room. Stilted chatter ensued, although I wasn't really paying attention. When I finally looked at the boy, really registering him for the first time, I noticed his backward baseball cap, his bright eyes, and his ridiculous goatee. With his laid-back, scruffy appearance, I assumed that he lacked substance. The contrast with my crisply formal, preppy boyfriend could not have been more pronounced.<br><br>Why had Stephanie wanted us to meet? I was a country girl, from a family that for generations had lived a modest, simple life. Rick had shown me a very different world--one that included penthouses, car services, ski vacations, nice restaurants, and art gallery openings. Not that any of that mattered. Stephanie could have brought Brad Pitt into the living room, and I still would have been angry at her for disrespecting my relationship. But the contrast between this disheveled college student and the shiny penny I was seeing made me wonder all the more what my sister had been thinking.<br><br>Before long, Stephanie yanked me from my silent perch and, trying to find a bit of privacy within her tiny studio apartment, chided me sternly. "Where are your manners?" she demanded. "Yell at me later if you like, but give this boy the courtesy of a proper conversation." She was, I saw immediately and with embarrassment, right. Being rude to a stranger--a guest!--was unacceptable. Courtesy and graciousness were qualities that had been instilled in us since birth by our parents, our grandparents, and the tight-knit community in which we'd been raised, and so far I had been as cold as ice.<br><br>Shamefaced, I went back to sit down and made my apologies to Michael. I told him that I was in a relationship and didn't know what Stephanie could possibly have been thinking when she'd arranged this meeting. Of course, I explained, I wasn't angry with him--only at my sister for putting the two of us in this ridiculous situation. With that out in the open, we laughed at the utter preposterousness of it and marveled at Stephanie's audacity. The tension in the room eased considerably, and the three of us fell into easy conversation. Michael told me about his classes and about an idea he had for a screenplay.<br><br>That's when I saw what Stephanie wanted me to see. The passion and drive that animated Michael when he spoke about his screenplay were unlike anything I'd seen in anyone I'd ever met. He sounded like me! I felt my stomach lurch and experienced a kind of vertigo. Instantly, I knew that my future, so certain only moments before, would not go according to plan. I would not be marrying my boyfriend. Although he was a wonderful man, that relationship was over. I had no choice in the matter. I'd known Michael Barnett for less than an hour, and yet with a certainty impossible to explain or defend, I already knew that I would be spending the rest of my life with him.</p><h2>Gone but Knot Forgotten (A Quilting Mystery)</h2><p>Sorting through the estate of a wealthy recluse may sound like a fascinating task, but when the skeletons in the closets turn out to be real, Martha and her quilting pals wish they'd stuck to basting and batting. . .<br><br>Martha Rose is stunned when she hears that her best friend from high school has passed away.

The only thing that makes sense to me is to use them in the service of the poor. It is at their feet that I find myself.&#x201d;<br>For almost ten years, Gary Smith, S.J., lived and worked among the poor of Portland, Oregon. With this memoir, he invites us to walk with him and meet some of the abandoned, over-looked, and forgotten members of our society with whom he has shared his life. Just as Smith found a deeper, truer understanding of himself and of the heart of God through his work, these people and their stories stand to transform us.&nbsp;&#x201c;Although its subject matter is bleak, the book is not. Smith has found love amid the despair. His book is touching, at times hopeful, and the kind of book that is hard to put down, that fascinates, horrifies, and rivets one&#x2019;s attention.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Smith takes us where we would rather not go, the heart of the poor, the lonely, and the abandoned.

His is a grungy looking room, needing a paint job. It has a small bathroom, a bed, a set of drawers for his clothes, and a tiny half-kitchen. The door leads out to the long and gloomy second-floor hallway of a four-story building. The window looks out onto a bleak inner court.<br>&nbsp;I had come to help him get ready for a doctor&#x2019;s appointment, and he talked as I helped him undress and get into the shower.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I have this dumb disease, in this stupid body,&#x201d; he slowly told me, &#x201c;which I hate.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The smallest tasks of this young man&#x2019;s daily life are the tortured efforts of time and concentration: unbuttoning a shirt, drinking a cup of coffee, unlocking a door, crossing a street. As I helped him dry off and dress, we chatted about our lives and our families.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;How many brothers do you have, Garibaldi?&#x201d; he asked, using his nickname for me. &#x201c;Are you married? What did you have for breakfast?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Two brothers, Studebaker,&#x201d; I replied, using my name for him, &#x201c;and a sister. No, I am not married, and I didn&#x2019;t eat breakfast.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;His speech reflects longings and deprivations in his life. He told me of his twin: &#x201c;He looks like me, but he is normal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Stewart has an unaffected candor. As a matter of fact, he has no idea what it means to be pretentious. What you see is what you get. If he is happy, it is all there; if he is sad, one has no doubt.<br>&nbsp;That is often the way for people with no power, no money, no exterior beauty. They have nothing to prove. And so Stewart is nonthreatening. He crashes through my defenses. He brings out what is good, whole, and deep down in me: the ability to love tenderly, speak truthfully, receive openly, and face gently my own weaknesses.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �<br>On my way to work every day, I walk down Third Street in Portland, in a section of the city called Old Town, through a scene played out in the poor areas of every large city in the United States: the unemployed looking for work; drug dealers furtively hawking their heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines; residents from the many SROs moving in and out of their buildings; burned-out alcoholics coming off or beginning another day of panhandling and drinking and misery; addicts engaging in the endless hunt for another fix; lines of people waiting to get food or clothes or shelter; the occasional nervous and fatigued prostitute wandering by; individuals talking incoherently to themselves; staff persons from a variety of agencies going about their work; alert police slowly surveying the streets on foot, on bikes, in cars.<br>&nbsp;All this activity takes place in an area comprising low-income SROs, a Salvation Army facility that feeds and houses the poor, a couple of rescue missions that also run drug rehab programs, storefront operations that come and go depending on money and interest, vacant buildings retained by speculators waiting for the economic boom to swallow Old Town, dark and dreary taverns, city-run shelters, parking lots that are full in the day and empty at night, a nonprofit restaurant that serves the needy of Old Town, a women&#x2019;s drop-in center, Outreach Ministry, a strip joint, an adult bookstore, and a community police station. Creeping into all of this, as Portland&#x2019;s economic prosperity asserts itself, are upscale coffee shops, some high-priced restaurants and mom-and-pop grocery stores, and SROs that are being converted into condos.<br>&nbsp;I live in the middle of it all in a room in the Downtown Chapel of St. Vincent de Paul Church. I wear several hats in terms of my ministry: working part-time for Outreach Ministry in Burnside (OMB), a money-management and personal care agency; assisting the Macdonald Center, a social outreach arm of the chapel, with SRO work; ministering to inmates at the county justice center; and hanging out on the streets.<br>&nbsp;On occasion I come across a young flutist in the downtown commercial area of Portland. He is an Ichabod Crane of a man, wiry and fragile, and looks as if he is made of broomsticks and baling wire. He is usually wearing baggy pants and a raggedy sweatshirt. His full head of hair flies in a dozen different directions, especially on a windy day. There is a beat-up old hat at his feet containing a few coins from appreciative fans. His entire self is absorbed in the furious tooting on his cheap wooden instrument.<br>&nbsp;Coming closer, one hears a strange thing: he&#x2019;s playing nonsense notes. No melody. No organized rhythm. The listener experiences incomprehensible music and the mysterious force that propels those flying fingers. The musician never seems to stop, lost in and driven by the inner power of some mysterious melody. He looks straight ahead, apparently oblivious to gawkers like me.<br>&nbsp;I linger for a few minutes whenever I see him. Inevitably I have created an imaginary scenario between us in which I approach Mr. Flutist and point out the obvious: &#x201c;Excuse me, sir, are you aware that your music is not making any sense?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;He drops the flute from his lips, eyes me, and says, with a hint of exasperation, &#x201c;So what? I&#x2019;m crazy. But, man, I&#x2019;ve got to play my song. I mean, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;This book is about my song. It is not all the music in me, but there is a lot of it here. It is a song primarily about the people with whom I have lived and worked over the past several years as part of my mission on the streets as a priest in the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits. I have changed most of their names, but their stories, their compelling stories, I could never change. I have tried to express how they have broken me open and helped me to understand my own heart, and how they have led me closer to the song of hope for all human beings, which is in the heart of God.<br>&nbsp;I write this book so that the reader will have a better understanding of the poor. I write it, too, to keep out in front of me a fundamental chord in my song: that the church, when it becomes poor and internalizes the suffering of the poor, understands compassion and the demands of justice. The just and compassionate church becomes the incarnation of the heart and song of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Two<br>Cockroaches, Conversation, and Collectors: <br>Inside the SROs<br>In the midst of one-way conversations, I am communicating all the time. I try to affirm this human being, so lost in his own world of memories, <br>bitter and sweet.<br>&nbsp;There is in me a longing to be real, to be authentic, to be a clear reflection of what my heart holds at its deepest levels. It is a goal that the gospel steadfastly holds up as an invitation to me, to the church. It is when the church embraces the gospel selflessly that it bears the heart of God and becomes real to the world. And when it is real, the church makes God believable.<br>&nbsp;This truth is the impelling force behind the ministry of the St. Vincent de Paul Downtown Chapel, where I live. The chapel sponsors a social service outreach program, in which I participate, out of a facility called the Macdonald Center. Macdonald Center takes its two-person teams of staff and volunteers into the forty-plus <br>single-room occupancy hotels in the Old Town/downtown Portland area. There in the SROs, within the confines of the small rooms, the teams spend time visiting with people who have limited, if any, contact with the outside world.<br>&nbsp;Like the dirt and concrete pockets under the Portland bridges or the recessed doorways on Skid Row, these rooms are the nooks and crannies of the city&#x2019;s poor and near homeless, and frequently, they are the spawning grounds of paralyzing feelings of separation and loneliness. Paradoxically, the darkness of such places is light for the church, because there the church is invited and challenged to claim what is best in itself: the ability to love compassionately, to serve unselfishly, to profess and speak to what is truthful.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �<br>I was in a hotel this afternoon, carrying on one of those endless conversations with Ned, who tells the same story over and over to anyone who will listen. He might as well play a cassette. That is, if he lets you in his room.<br>&nbsp;Ned is in his late seventies, one of those rare birds who has lived that long in spite of pounding down a fifth of vodka a day and complementing his drinking with a couple packs of cigarettes.<br>&nbsp;While he was in the middle of his monologue, a cockroach appeared, laboriously climbing up the wall behind him. It was huge; in fact, it was so huge that it couldn&#x2019;t retain its adhesion to the wall, and about a quarter of the way up, it crashed to the floor. It followed this cycle repeatedly: climbing the wall, falling off, and beginning its bloated way back up again. Sort of a metaphor for Ned&#x2019;s stories.<br>&nbsp;He regaled me once again with tales of his lost family and of how his two sons had dumped him (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all their fault&#x201d;), of the crackpots in his hotel (&#x201c;Why do they let nuts like that in here?&#x201d;), and of his World War II exploits.<br>&nbsp;Such conversations take place in the confines of these obscure little rooms. These encounters are the essence of the ministry of presence. In the midst of one-way conversations, I am communicating all the time. I try to affirm this human being, so lost in his own world of memories, bitter and sweet. I could try to preach religion to the shut-in, but it would be like talking about high-speed particle physics. And even if I did, he or she would, one way or another, show me to the door.<br>&nbsp;No, I bide my time and wait, trying to pace them in their conversation, believing that in the presence of my brand of love they will discover within themselves the capacity to uncover that inner spirit that has been buried under bad decisions, bitterness, booze, and dizzying loneliness. And I don&#x2019;t say this with condescension or superiority. I&#x2019;ve experienced that presence of love myself, and in that presence I have grown, even when I had built some barbed-wire fences around myself. I trust that my way of being present to Ned will be used by God.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �<br>One of the factors of SRO life is cockroaches. If you don&#x2019;t like being distracted while having a conversation, try talking fairly serious stuff in an SRO, where roaches run up the walls or crawl out from underneath coat collars.<br>&nbsp;Many SRO residents throughout Old Town have been awakened by their smoke alarms, triggered not by smoke but by a roach looking for a dark and cozy home. Roll over, go back to sleep. No fire; it&#x2019;s just a roach.<br>&nbsp;Sometimes I get a sense of how long someone has lived in a particular room by the condition of the smashed roaches on the wall: fresh wall kill means the resident has recently moved in; petrified wall kill translates into a veteran occupant. One becomes an amateur archaeologist with a specialty in cockroaches.<br>&nbsp;Robert&#x2019;s roaches always were in a herd around a hot-water pipe at its junction with the ceiling. He even had names for some of them and could identify them as they wandered off in solitary fashion across the walls of his dingy, dirty SRO room. I knew another guy who named his roaches after Old Testament prophets.<br>&nbsp;One old fellow we visit has legions of the things, in all sizes, scurrying and surveying as they traverse tables, bed, walls, clothes, food. There are even scouts moving along the bed on which he sits day in and day out. He keeps a piece of paper tightly rubber-banded around his pipe&#x2014;stem and bowl&#x2014;to keep them out.<br>&nbsp;When I was a community organizer in Oakland, California, one of the first cases I tackled involved a woman with a serious roach problem living in an east Oakland neighborhood. On either side of her residence were speculator-owned vacant houses. She nearly gassed herself to death with Raid because the roaches from the vacant houses were invading her home like army ants. The owner of those vacant houses couldn&#x2019;t have cared less, even after written complaints and phone calls. Then he was invited to a neighborhood meeting to rectify the situation, under the threat&#x2014;if he refused&#x2014;of bringing half the neighborhood to his residence with an abundant supply of bottled roaches. Naturally, the neighborhood organization assured him, Raid would be provided free of charge.<br>&nbsp;The politics of cockroaches is one that always forces the poor to lead the charge. Why is it so hard for hotel owners to regularly attend to the problem of roaches? And how much should one complain? Same point could be made for mice or rats. Why should people who spend more than a third of their income for housing&#x2014;housing that is often poor and code defiant&#x2014;not be protected from property owners who are indifferent to health hazards?<br>&nbsp;Of course, roaches will always be with us. Ditto for rats, lice, and mice. Such creatures will always have a foothold in poor areas, but that is no excuse for not endeavoring to keep the problem under control. In some cases nothing is done to rectify the situation because the owners are greedy, and the poor have little power.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �<br>Gene rolled toward me in his wheelchair. He is a fifty-three-year-old man, battling cancer and diabetes. He is a Vietnam vet but doesn&#x2019;t like to talk about that &#x201c;bleeping war.&#x201d; Underneath his wisdom and an amazing amount of cheerfulness, I can feel his anger.<br>&nbsp;In a strange story, he laughingly told me of the day of great &#x201c;Christmas cheer.&#x201d; He was trying to make a little extra money, so he got a job as a Salvation Army bell ringer in front of a local department store. While he was ringing away, his colostomy bag broke. He said he was assisted to the emergency room by one of the folks who regularly dumped money into the pot. He was laughing about it all because he never returned to his station and had not a clue what might have happened to the money. For sure, he won&#x2019;t be seeing any of it, and he doubted that he would be hired again.<br>&nbsp;With Gene off to other things, I ran into John, who was into another devastating drunk. I am always astonished by the amount of drinking that people can do and still live. John is a case in point.<br>&nbsp;In contrast to the optimistic viewpoint of humanity that Gene has, John told me that &#x201c;some rip-off car tow man&#x201d; tried to charge him 150 bucks for the overnight tow of his car off a lot, after the lot owner had told John that he could leave his car (an Olympic-class clunker) on the lot for two days. John said that his anger forced the tow man to back down, and he was charged only a hundred dollars. So there was John telling me the story, walking with me down the hotel hallway, his arm draped over my shoulder. It was amusing to hear him say, &#x201c;No way was I going to let that guy fuck with me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Sure, John, yet you got so mad that you proceeded to drink yourself silly.<br>&nbsp;He bade me good-bye and ducked into his room.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;n...</p><h2>Your Longevity Blueprint: Building A Healthier Body Through Functional Medicine</h2><p>Your Body Is Your Home, Build It With Functional Medicine&nbsp;<br><br>How well are you aging?

Together they plan, compose, and review text in a variety of genres. The &#x201c;interactive&#x201d; piece involves group collaboration in planning and composing the writing through guided conversation and a unique &#x201c;sharing the pen&#x201d; technique where students do the actual writing.&nbsp;<br> Interactive writing harnesses the natural interactions teachers have with their students as they compose a writing piece. It allows for real-time differentiation and tailored scaffolding. Interactive writing fits within any writing curriculum and can be adapted to your classroom&#x2019;s technology levels.&nbsp;<br><i>Interactive Writing Across Grades: A Small Practice with Big Results, Pre-K&#x2013;5</i> is your how-to guide, unpacking this powerful method step by step&#x2014;and grade by grade. The authors help you figure out where and how interactive writing fits within your literacy framework, regardless of the grade you teach. In these pages, you&#x2019;ll find the following:<ul><li>An overview of the interactive writing method and how it fits into your balanced literacy program</li><li>Concrete ways to launch interactive writing in your classroom to support both process and craft instruction</li><li>Step-by-step guidance to implement the method with students of all ages</li><li>Real classroom writing from every grade that shows what to expect at each phase of the process</li><li>&#x201c;Listen in on a Lesson&#x201d; vignettes that demonstrate the type of scaffolding you can offer during interactive writing lessons</li></ul>Discover what makes interactive writing a particularly effective teaching practice that can support both emergent and fluent writers. <i>Interactive Writing Across Grades </i>can help you put this method to work in your classroom immediately.<br> Grades PreK-5<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>The story of the book&nbsp;<i>Interactive Writing Across the Grades: A Small Practice with Big Results, PreK-5</i>&nbsp;begins over twenty years ago when Kate was a new teacher. She was trying different methods of instruction to help her first graders learn to read and write. At that time, Irene Fountas was the literacy coordinator in her school. She was advocating that teachers incorporate a relatively new method called interactive writing. Together Irene and Kate taught interactive writing lessons in Kate&#x2019;s classroom, and Kate was hooked from the beginning. &#x201c;I loved the energy of the lessons, the way I was pulling together my entire literacy curriculum in every interactive writing session, the opportunity to reach so many students at different levels while creating a community of writers, and the rich and authentic products we created.&#x201d;</p><p>Throughout the next several years, Kate implemented interactive writing on a daily basis with her primary grade students in both urban and suburban classrooms. It became one of the core teaching practices in her class. During this time she also trained as a Reading Recovery teacher. &#x201c;The more I learned about students&#x2019; literacy development and how assessment informs good instruction, the more I was convinced of the power of this practice to help improve students&#x2019; independent writing.&#x201d;</p><p>When Kate pursued her Doctorate in Language and Literacy at Harvard University, her research focused on interactive writing in the primary grades. She was thrilled, although not surprised, that her research findings confirmed her classroom experience: interactive writing is a powerful method for improving children&#x2019;s independent writing.</p><p>These results fueled Kate&#x2019;s decision to refine and expand her understanding of interactive writing through additional action-research and coaching both in the United States and China, where she lived for over five years with her family. During this time she wrote articles for professional journals, presented on interactive writing at conferences, and published twenty books for children on how to write as part of the Language Arts Explorer Junior series. Her passion, however, was and continues to be supporting teachers in all elementary grades as they take on this practice in their own classrooms.</p><p>Kate now lives in Connecticut with her husband and three children.</p><br><br><p>Joan&#x2019;s 25-year career in education has afforded her the opportunity to spend time in many interesting places and to work with countless thoughtful colleagues. Currently, she is the Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning in Wellesley, MA. Prior to this, she held a wide range of positions including: K-12 teacher, literacy coach, adjunct professor, national consultant, curriculum writer, and district administrator. She has taught, consulted, or conducted research in schools and districts across the country including Baltimore, Boston, Cambridge, Detroit, Hawaii, Houston, Louisville and Montgomery County. She spent ten years as a classroom teacher (grades K-2 and 4-5) before becoming a school-based literacy coach. She went on to be a district coach and the Director of Literacy in the Boston Public Schools. In each of these roles, Joan has embraced the chance to collaborate with others who share her commitment to positively impact the lives of children through literacy.</p><p>Joan&#x2019;s interest in writing instruction &#x2013; specifically interactive writing &#x2013; initially stems from her own struggles as a grade 4-5 classroom teacher. During writers&#x2019; workshop, she did what she knew: modeled her own writing, scribed for her students, and read-aloud many mentor texts written by award-winning authors. She also dabbled in the six traits and frequently analyzed her students&#x2019; writing seeking answers for where to go next. While much of this helped her students, she sensed they needed more explicit guidance. This feeling grew as she visited many classrooms as a district coach and then a national consultant. She also recognized a common challenge: writing instruction was not given the time nor the attention it needed. Moreover, the teachers she met were looking for ways to develop their student writers and were eager for concrete guidance on how to do so efficiently and effectively. When her co-author, Kate Roth, approached her to write about interactive writing, it was an easy sell!</p><p>Since 2007, Joan has been a national literacy consultant, presenter and curriculum writer.&nbsp; Her literacy and leadership consulting work has focused mainly in urban school districts where low-income students and students of color may struggle to meet the ever-demanding reading and writing standards. She also serves as a literacy advisor to The Education Trust, a nonprofit organization that advocates for high academic achievement for all students. With Ed Trust, she co-authored, Checking In: Do Classroom Assignments Reflect Today&#x2019;s Higher Standards?, a national report that summarized an analysis of over 1800 middle school literacy assignments in English language arts, history and science. &nbsp;Joan is most passionate about supporting school-based efforts to improve and refine literacy practices through a wide range of adult learning experiences.</p><p>Joan began her career in Teach for America and earned a master&#x2019;s degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.&nbsp; She went on to earn her Doctorate of Education in K-12 School Leadership at Vanderbilt University, Peabody College. She is lives in Massachusetts with her husband (a long time school principal) and their two teenaged children.</p>Kate Roth and Joan Dabrowski's Interactive Writing Across Grades: A Small Practice with Big Results (9781625311153, $27.95) covers the basics of interactive writing experiences and their educational foundations, and will appeal to PreK-5 grade level teachers looking for a step-by-step application of the concepts to writing methods and teaching approaches. Chapters provide examples of real classroom writing from different grades as they illustrate different phrases of interactive writing teaching and show how to build skills, while classroom case history examples emphasize the experiences and process even more. The result is a solid guide for any teacher of these grade levels who would integrate an interactive writing program into the classroom.<br><br> The Bookwatch: July 2016<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Business of Child Care: Management and Financial Strategies</h2><p>Child care administrators will greatly value the business skills detailed in The Business of Child Care: Managment and Financial Strategies.

Rather than attempting to secure early equality, Black is fighting for the initiative from the very first moves. White is allowed to build up an early central advantage but Black relies on the middlegame, hoping that the central installations that White has constructed will become unwieldy and vulnerable to a devastating counterattack. In many variations, White pursues material or strategic gains but in return Black has tactical and attacking opportunities. The King's Indian Defence appeals to players who arrive at the board prepared for a fight.<br><br>The Move by Move series provides an ideal format for the keen chessplayer to improve their game. While reading you are continually challenged to answer probing questions &#x2013; a method that greatly encourages the learning and practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of chess knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to study chess while providing the best possible chance to retain what has been learnt.<br><br><ul><li>Everything you need to know about the King's Indian Defence.</li><li>The Q and A approach emphasizes plans and strategies.</li><li>Written by an expert on the opening.</li></ul></p><p>The best resource available to class players on the KID at the moment is The Kings Indian Move by Move by IM Sam Collins. In less than two hundred and forty page the author helps the reader to understand the KID, play the best moves in different variations according to current theory and inject new life in Black's play against the super solid Fianchetto Variation. As usual the annotations by Collins are great and the twenty nine games are enough for an amateur to start on the right foot his chess career as a KID devotee. (Miguel Ararat <i>FloridaChess, Spring 2019</i>)<br><br>Overall, though, Collins has produced a highly-accessible introductory guide to one of the most popular openings. I feel players looking to take up the opening or aiming to fill in the gaps in their KID repertoire will find this book a suitable successor to Gallagher's 2002 work. (Paul Hopwood <i>CHESS Magazine</i>)<br><br>I found this book essential in order to give me the systematic knowledge to understand more difficult works on the KID. It is true we have hundreds of books on the KID, but the real problem is how to tackle the learning of the material. There should be a kind of staircase to success, and on each step there is a book. On the first step this is the book one needs to read to grasp the general ideas.

From Bridget Murphy, the foremother who touched shore at East Boston in 1849, to the intelligent, independent Kennedy women of today, Laurence Leamer tells their unforgettable stories.<br><br>Here are the private thoughts of Kathleen, the flirtatious debutante in prewar England . . . the truth behind Joe Kennedy&#x2019;s insistence that his mildly retarded daughter, Rosemary, be lobotomized . . . the real story behind Joan and Ted&#x2019;s whirlwind romance . . . Jackie&#x2019;s desire for a divorce from JFK in the 1950s . . . Pat Lawford&#x2019;s disastrous Hollywood marriage . . . how Caroline discovered her cousin David&#x2019;s death by overdose, and more.<br><br>Tough enough to withstand the unimaginable, these Kennedy women soldier on in the name of their extraordinary family and what they believe is right.<br><br>"MASTERFUL . . . AN ENDLESSLY FASCINATING READ . . . A wealth of beautifully rendered social detail, at times reading like a realist novel by Edith Wharton . . . [A] page-turner from start to finish."<br>&#x2014;The Dallas Morning News</p><p><b>Laurence Leamer&nbsp;</b>is best known for his trilogy on the Kennedys:&nbsp;<i>The Kennedy Women, The Kennedy Men,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Sons of Camelot.</i>&nbsp;His book&nbsp;<i>Playing for Keeps in Washington&nbsp;w</i>as named a notable book of the year by <i>The&nbsp;New York Times</i>. He also wrote the bestseller&nbsp;<i>Make-Believe: The&nbsp;Story of Nancy and Ronald Reagan.</i>Another Kennedy family saga, this one focusing on the women, from Irish forebears to feminist Rory Kennedy, daughter of Robert and Ethel. For Kennedy aficionados, much of the material is familiar. In 1849, immigrants Bridget Murphy and Patrick Kennedy met on the boat from Ireland. Nine years after their marriage, she was a widow with four children who worked as a domestic servant, then bought and ran a variety store. In some ways, for the women of the Kennedy family, Bridget's story is as inspiring as it gets. From Rose, who married Bridget's grandson, Joe, to some two dozen grandchildren, author Leamer (King of the Night, 1989) tells a story that is as sad as it is tragic, with Rose as its center. In the grip of the Roman Catholic Church--which saw the role of a woman as mother and moral center--Rose changed from an ambitious, lively, curious girl to a wife and mother whose emotions were rigidly controlled and whose mechanisms of denial so highly refined that she could accept her husband's lovers--notably Gloria Swanson--into her home. She passed much of that legacy on to her daughters Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean. Open displays of tenderness were reserved for Rosemary, the retarded child, who was lobotomized and institutionalized out of the public eye. Kathleen is captured as the American who enchanted English society until her death in a plane crash; Eunice as the most successful in building a life of her own. Pat and Jean were not so lucky. The prickly paths of the daughters-in-law--Jackie, Joan, and Ethel--are included here as well. Although the ambitions of many of Rose's granddaughters, including Maria Shriver and Caroline Kennedy, have been tempered by marriage and children, theirs is a generation that seems to have shaken off the chains of Kennedy women as victims of a moral dichotomy. By ferreting out new sources and new material and putting the familiar tales into a broader social context, Leamer gives a clearer if not always brighter picture of what it means to be a Kennedy woman.

It was impor�tant that James be there with me. <br><i><br>OMG,</i> I typed. <i>Why not? </i><br><br>I received his reply seconds before stepping into the shower. <i>Gotta work late,</i> he said, and how could I argue? We were both lawyers, seven years out of law school. We had talked about working our tails off now to pay our dues, and I had been in total agreement at fi rst. Lately, though, we had seen little of each other, and it was getting worse. When I pointed this out to James, he got a helpless look in his eyes, like, <i>What can I do? </i><br><br>I tried to relax under the hot spray, but I kept arguing aloud that there were things we could do if we wanted to be together&#x2014;that love should trump work&#x2014;that we had to make changes before we had kids, or what was the point&#x2014;that my coyote dreams had begun when I started getting letters from Jude Bell, and though I stuffed those letters under the bed and out of sight, a tiny part of me knew they were there. <br><br>I had barely left the shower when my BlackBerry dinged again. No surprise. My boss, Walter Burbridge, always e-mailed at 6:30. <br><i><br>Client wants an update,</i> he wrote. <i>Can you do it by ten? </i><br><br>Here&#x2019;s a little background. I used to be an idealist. Starting law school, I had dreamed of defending innocent people against corpo�rate wrongdoing, and by graduation was itching to be involved in an honest-to-goodness class action lawsuit. Now I am. Only I&#x2019;m the bad guy. The case on which I work involves a company that produces bottled water that was tainted enough to cause irreparable harm to a frightening number of people. The company has agreed to compen�sate the victims. My job is to determine how many, how sick, and how little we can get away with doling out, and I don&#x2019;t work alone. We are fifty lawyers, each with a cubicle, computer, and headset. I&#x2019;m one of five supervisors, any of whom could have compiled an update, but because Walter likes women, he comes to me. <br><br>I&#x2019;m thirty-two, stand five-six, weigh one-twenty. I spin some�times, but mostly power walk and do yoga, so I&#x2019;m in shape. My hair is auburn and long, my eyes brown, my skin clear. <br><i><br>We gave them an update Monday,</i> I typed with my thumbs. <br><i><br>Get it to me by ten,</i> he shot back. <br><br>Could I refuse? Of course not. I was grateful to have a job at a time when many of my law school friends were wandering the streets looking for work. I was looking, too, but there was nothing to be had, which meant that arguing with the partner-in-charge of a job I <i>did </i>have was not a wise thing to do. <br><br>Besides, I mused as I slipped on my watch, if I was to put together an update by ten, I had to make tracks. <br><br>My BlackBerry didn&#x2019;t cooperate. I was hurrying to finish my makeup when it began making noise. The wife of one of James&#x2019;s partners wanted the name of a pet sitter. I didn&#x2019;t have a pet, but could certainly ask a friend who did. Thinking that I would have had a dog or cat in a minute if our lifestyle allowed it, I was zipping on a pair of black slacks when another e-mail arrived. <i>Why won&#x2019;t sharks attack lawyers?</i> said the subject line, and I instantly clicked delete. Lynn Fal�lon had been in my study group our first year in law school. She now worked with a small firm in Kansas, surely having a kinder, gentler experience than those of us in New York, and she loves lawyer jokes. I do not. I was feeling bad enough about what I do. Besides, when Lynn sent a joke, it went to dozens of people, and I don&#x2019;t do group e-mail. <br><br>Nor do I do anything but blue blouses, I realized in dismay as I stood at the closet. Blue blouses were professional, my lawyer side argued, but I was bored looking at them. Closing my eyes, I chose a blouse&#x2014;any blouse&#x2014;and was doing buttons when the BB dinged again. <br><i><br>Okay, Emily,</i> wrote my sister. <i>You booked the restaurant, but you haven&#x2019;t done music, photography, or flowers. Why are you dragging your heels? </i><br><i><br>Kelly, it is 7 am,</i> I wrote back and tossed the BlackBerry on the bed. I turned on the radio, heard the word &#x201c;terrorism,&#x201d; and turned it off. I was brushing my hair back into a wide barrette when my sister&#x2019;s reply arrived. <br><i><br>Right, and in two minutes I have to get the kids dressed and fed, then do the same for me so I can get to work, which is why I&#x2019;m counting on you for this. What&#x2019;s the problem? </i><br><i><br>This party is over the top,</i> I typed back. <br><i><br>We agreed. You do the work, I pay. </i><br><i><br>Mom doesn&#x2019;t want this,</i> I argued, but my sister was relentless. <br><i><br>Mom will love it. She only turns 60 once. I need help with this, Emily. I can&#x2019;t hear myself think when I get home from work. If you had kids you&#x2019;d know. </i><br><br>It was a low blow. Kelly knew we were trying. She knew we had undergone tests and were doing the intensive-sex-at-ovulation routine. She didn&#x2019;t know that I&#x2019;d gotten my period again this month, but I couldn&#x2019;t bear to write the words, and then&#x2014;<i>ding, ding, ding</i>&#x2014;my in-box began filling. It was 7:10. I had to get to work. Burying the BlackBerry in the depths of my purse so that I wouldn&#x2019;t hear the noise, I grabbed my coat and took off. <br><br>We lived in Gramercy Park in a condo we could barely afford, and though we didn&#x2019;t have a key to the park itself, we had passed Julia Roberts on the street a time or two. I saw nothing today&#x2014;no Julia, no pretty brownstones, no promising June day&#x2014;as I hurried to Fifth Avenue, sprinting the last half block to catch the bus as it pulled up at the curb. <br><br>I was at my desk at 7:45, and I wasn&#x2019;t the first. A low drone of voices already hovered over the cubicles. I awoke my computer and logged in, then logged in twice more at different levels of database security. Waiting for the final one, I checked my BlackBerry. <br><i><br>Are you going to yoga?</i> asked the paralegal who worked two floors below me and hated going to yoga alone. I would be happy going alone, since it meant less chatter and more relaxation, which was the whole point of yoga. But if I had to go home to change before the firm dinner, yoga was out. <i>Not tonight,</i> I typed. <br><i><br>Colly wants Vegas,</i> wrote a book group friend. Colleen Parker was getting married in September, and though I had only known her for the two years I&#x2019;d been in the group, she had asked me to be a brides�maid. I would be one of a dozen, paying three hundred dollars each to wear matching dresses. And now a bachelorette party in Vegas? I was thinking the whole thing was tacky, when I spotted the next note. <br><i><br>Hey, Emily,</i> wrote Ryan Mcfee. Ryan worked one cubicle down, two over. <i>Won&#x2019;t be in today. Have the flu. Don&#x2019;t want to spread it around. </i><br><br>This should have been important. It meant one man-day of lost work. But what was one more or less in a huge cubicle room? <br><br>Logged in now, I set to gathering Walter&#x2019;s information. It was 7:50. By 8:25 I had a tally of the calls we&#x2019;d received from last week�end&#x2019;s newspaper ads&#x2014;and I could understand why our client was worried. The number of claimants was mounting fast. Each had been rated on a ten-point scale by the lawyer taking the call, with tens being the most severely affected and ones being the least. There were also zeros; these were the easiest to handle. When callers tried to cash in on a settlement with proof neither of harm nor of having ever pur�chased the product, they stood out. <br><br>The others were the ones over which I agonized. <br><br>But statistics were impersonal and, in that, relatively painless. I updated the figures on how many follow-ups we had done since Monday, with a numerical breakdown and brief summaries of the claims. At 8:55 I e-mailed the spreadsheet to Walter, logged in the time I&#x2019;d spent making it, shot a look at my watch, and dashed down� stairs for breakfast. Though I passed colleagues in the elevator, being competitors in the game of billable hours, we did little more than nod. <br><br>Going from the thirty-fifth floor to the ground and up again took time, so it wasn&#x2019;t until 9:10 that I was back at my desk with a donut and coffee. By then the cubicles were filled, the tap of computer keys louder, and the drone of voices more dense. I had barely washed down a bite of donut when the phone began to blink. Hooking the earpiece <br>over my head, I logged in on my time sheet, pulled up a clear screen on my computer, and clicked into the call. <br><br>&#x201c;Lane Lavash,&#x201d; I answered, as was protocol with calls coming in on the toll-free lines listed in our ads. &#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d; <br><br>There was silence, then a timid &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I got this number from the paper.&#x201d; <br><br>Frauds were confident. This woman sounded young and unsure. &#x201c;Which paper?&#x201d; I asked gently. <br><br>&#x201c;The, uh, the <i>Telegram.</i> In Portland. Maine.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Do you live in Portland?&#x201d; I readied my fingers to enter this information. <br><br>&#x201c;No. I was there with my brother last weekend and saw the ad. I live in Massachusetts.&#x201d; <br><br>I dropped my hands. Massachusetts was prime Eagle River dis�tribution area. We&#x2019;d received calls from as far away as Oregon, from people who had been vacationing in New England during the time the tainted water was on sale. Strict documentation of travel was required for these claims, well before we looked at documentation of physical harm. <br><br>I cupped my hands in my lap. &#x201c;Do you have cause for a claim against Eagle River?&#x201d; <br><br>Her voice remained hesitant. &#x201c;My husband says no. He says that these things just happen.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What things?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Miscarriages.&#x201d; <br><br>I hung my head. This was not what I wanted to hear, but the din of voices around me said that if not this woman, someone else would be getting pieces of the Eagle River settlement. Miscarriage was definitely one of the &#x201c;harms&#x201d; on our list. <br><br>&#x201c;Have you had one?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Two.&#x201d; <br><br>I entered that in the form on my screen, and when the words didn&#x2019;t appear, retyped them, but the form remained blank. Knowing that I wouldn&#x2019;t forget this, and not wanting to lose the momentum of the call, I asked, &#x201c;Recently?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The first one was a year and a half ago.&#x201d; <br><br>My heart sank. &#x201c;Had you been drinking Eagle River water?&#x201d; Of course she had. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Can you document that?&#x201d; I asked in a kind voice, though I felt cold and mean. <br><br>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;mean, like, do I have a receipt? See, that&#x2019;s one of the reasons my husband didn&#x2019;t want me to call. I pay cash, and I don&#x2019;t <i>have</i> receipts. My husband says I should&#x2019;ve made a connection between the water and the miscarriage back then, but, like, bottled water is always safe, right? Besides, we were just married and there was other stuff going <br>on, and I figured I was miscarrying because it wasn&#x2019;t the right time for me to be pregnant.&#x201d; Her voice shrank. &#x201c;Now it is, only they say there&#x2019;s something wrong with the baby.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My mind filled with static. I tried to remember the company line. &#x201c;The Eagle River recall was eighteen months ago. The water has been clean since then. It wouldn&#x2019;t harm your baby.&#x201d; <br><br>I heard a meek half-cry. &#x201c;The thing is, we try to buy in bulk because it&#x2019;s cheaper that way. So we had a couple of twenty-fours in the basement and kind of forgot about them. Then I got pregnant, and my husband lost his job, and money was really tight, so I saw the water and thought I was doing good by using what we had instead of buying fresh. I didn&#x2019;t know about the recall.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It was in all the newspapers.&#x201d; <br><i><br>I don&#x2019;t read newspapers,</i> the ensuing silence said. &#x201c;Newspapers cost money.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;So does bottled water.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But the water from the tap tastes so <i>bad.</i> We thought of putting a filter on, but that costs more than the bottled water, and it&#x2019;s not like we own this place.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe your tap water is tainted,&#x201d; I said, playing to script. &#x201c;Have you asked your landlord to test it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, because my husband drinks it, and he&#x2019;s healthy. I&#x2019;m the only one with the problem, and I only drink bottled water. I noticed your newspaper ad because I always drink Eagle River.&#x201d; Her voice was a whispered wail. &#x201c;They say the baby won&#x2019;t be right, and my husband wants to get rid of it, and I have to make a decision, and I don&#x2019;t know <br>what to do. This <i>sucks.</i>&#x201d; <br><br>It did suck. <i>All</i> of it. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do,&#x201d; she repeated, and I realized she wanted my advice, but how could I give that? I was the enemy, an agent for the company whose product had caused a deformity in her child. She should have been yelling at me, calling me the most coldhearted per�son in the world. Some of them did. There had been the man whose seamstress wife had developed tremors in her hands and was perma�nently disabled. Or the woman whose husband had died&#x2014;and yes, he had a pre-existing medical condition, but he would have lived longer if he hadn&#x2019;t drunk tainted water. <br><br>The names they called me weren&#x2019;t pretty, and though I told myself not to take it personally, I did. Thinking that this job <i>definitely</i> sucked, I swiveled sideways and lowered my eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Emily. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Layla,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t try to enter it on my form. Nor did I ask for a last name. This had become a personal discussion. &#x201c;Have you talked with your doctor about options?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;There are only two,&#x201d; she said, sounding frightened. I guessed her to be in her early twenties. &#x201c;My mother says I shouldn&#x2019;t kill my baby. She says God chose me to protect an imperfect child, but she isn&#x2019;t the one who&#x2019;ll be paying medical bills or maybe losing a husband because of it.&#x201d; <i>Losing a husband</i> . . . Not on the formal list of &#x201c;harms&#x201d; but a plausible side effect, one that had to resonate with any married woman in this room. <br><br>Or maybe not. We didn&#x2019;t talk about this&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t talk about much of anything, because we were being paid by the hour to do our work, and time sheets would only allow for a lapse or two. What I was doing now was against the rules. I was supposed to stick to business and limit the time of each call. But Layla was talking quickly, going on about the bills that were piling up, and I couldn&#x2019;t cut her off. Somewhere in the middle of it, she said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good person, I can tell by your voice, so my husband was wrong when he said I&#x2019;d be talking to a robot. He also said we&#x2019;d have to sign away our lives if we...</p><h2>Christmas Is Here</h2><p>And the angel said unto them, &#x201c;Fear not: for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.&#x201d;<br> <br>Audiences from religious and secular worlds alike are familiar with the comforting words from the second chapter of Luke in the King James Bible, most memorably featured in A Charlie Brown Christmas. Just as Linus reminded his community of the real meaning of Christmas, this touching tribute to an ancient text reminds us to focus on family and our fellow man instead of on gifts and indulgences. Accompanying the timeless, reassuring text is sweet, nostalgic artwork from acclaimed illustrator Lauren Castillo that embraces today&#x2019;s ever-changing definition of family.</p><p>Lauren Castillo is the illustrator of several wonderful picture books including What Happens on Wednesdays by Emily Jenkins and That&#39;s Papa&#39;s Way by Kate Banks. Her books have received starred reviews from School Library Journal, Publisher&#39;s Weekly, Kirkus and Booklist. She lives in Brooklyn, NY.PreS-Gr 3&#x2013;The only text in this book is a few sentences from the King James Bible, and many of the ink and watercolor illustrations, in soothing tones of brown and gray with bold outlines, are wordless. They show a modern family&#x2013;mom, dad, babe in arms, and dog-walking child&#x2013;out for a stroll on a snowy evening, when they come across a small, outdoor Christmas pageant. As the child peers into the manger, readers are taken back in time to Bethlehem, with illustrations of sheep grazing over a dry Middle Eastern landscape as the shepherds learn of the birth of Jesus. As light from the star streams down over the holy family and shepherds leaning over the manger, the scene switches with a turn of the page back to the modern family singing carols in the snow in front of the manger. The theme&#x2013;that the most basic meaning of Christmas has remained the same over the centuries&#x2013;is conveyed with a warm and captivating simplicity that even the youngest child will understand.<i>Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

But he also offers insightful commentary on how jazz changed the way the world would look at music.<br>This complete overview includes:<ul><li>The major types of jazz and the significant jazz musicians of the 20th century</li><li>The roots of jazz, including its European and African influences</li><li>Extensive sidebars with recommended listening, plus exhaustive appendices on jazz singers, record guides, and more</li></ul><i>Jazz 101</i> makes jazz, with all its intricacies of artistry and vast array of forms, accessible to readers in fluid, entertaining prose.</p><p><strong>John F. Szwed</strong> is currently a professor of anthropology, African and African-American studies, music, and American studies at Yale University. He has written seven books on music and African-American culture and numerous articles and reviews on related subjects. His honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowship. He lives in Connecticut.In this idiosyncratic introduction to jazz, John Szwed's tone is refreshing--he's not ideological (jazz writers have a tendency to be dismissive of certain styles or artists), he recognizes that jazz didn't end in 1960 (see Ken Burns), and his notes on landmark recordings are concise gems. Grover Gardner's reading is entirely competent, but he's like a pianist with great chops and no swing. To be fair, he's hindered by the book's disorganized structure and by the editorial decision to include the CD catalog numbers in the narration. A more creative production would have brought out the strengths of this book.

After spending several years as a magazine art director and graphic designer, Cooke switched careers and began working in animation, where he contributed to such shows as Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series and Men In Black: The Series. From there, DC Comics approached Cooke to write and illustrate a project that the artist had submitted to the company years earlier: BATMAN: EGO. The critical success of the title led to more freelance work, including the relaunch of the CATWOMAN series with writer Ed Brubaker (which inspired Cooke to write and draw the graphic novel CATWOMAN: SELINA&#39;S BIG SCORE).

He has left behind his career and his girlfriend, Lorena, to pay self-imposed penance for an awful misstep on an old murder case. But the old ghosts are about to come roaring back.<br><br>There are plenty of difficult actors in Hollywood, and then there's Alastair Pinch. <br><br>Alastair is a onetime Royal Shakespeare Company thespian who now slums it as the "wise" Southern judge on a tacky network show. He's absurdly rich, often belligerent, and typically drunk--a damning combination when Alastair's wife is found dead on their living room floor and he can't remember what happened. <br><br>Waldo's old flame Lorena, hiding peril of her own, draws him toward the case, and Alastair's greedy network convinces Waldo to take it on. But after such a long time away from both civilization and sleuthing--and plagued by a confounding array of assailants who want him gone--Waldo must navigate complicated webs of ego and deceit to clear Alastair's name . . . or confirm his guilt.</p><p><b>Howard Michael Gould</b> began his career on Madison Avenue before moving to Los Angeles, where he has worked as a screenwriter and playwright as well as executive producer and head writer on a number of network comedies. <i>Last Looks</i> is his first novel.One<br><br> As he scrubbed one sock in the day's supply of well water, noting that his stitches had not held and the hole in the toe had reopened, he considered once again the problem of the One Hundred Things, as he had every day, every hour of every day, for the past three years.<br><br> The wash bucket was a Thing, as was the work shirt he'd just scrubbed, as were the boxers. He knew some minimalists counted all of their clothing as one Thing, but not the serious ones. So the shirt and jeans and boxers he was wearing right now were three more Things, and the windbreaker slung over the post behind him was a fourth. Those were simple. Socks, though-socks were more complicated, drawing him into the tricky land of plurals and singulars and naming, where the line between reason and rationalization was the disputed border in nothing less than a war for his soul.<br><br> That battle had raged ever since he resolved to pare his possessions down to the One Hundred. His books, he had decided then, were not One Library, they were dozens and dozens of Things, so he donated them all to a home for indigent seniors and bought a Kindle. But the pins and needles and tiny spools of polyester and the needle threader-they were fairly elements of One Sewing Kit. Those choices were the stuff of certainty and easy conscience, true to the organizing principle of his life and the purpose of his days, the slim reed he'd grasped during the worst of times, the redemptive positive he'd built on a simple catechism of negatives:<br><br> Don't want, don't acquire, don't require.<br><br> Don't affect.<br><br> Don't hurt.<br><br> Ah, but socks. Back when he was whittling down his final list, struggling to find eight more Things he could live without, he decided, not without guilt, that his four industrial-strength boot socks were Two Things, not Four, that a pair of socks was a pair of socks, rather than a pair of socks, just as a pair of boxers was not in fact a pair. That decision helped him get down to the One Hundred, but it still gnawed at him some days.<br><br> Today was one of those days, what with one sock almost beyond repair yet its mate still good and sturdy. He could take out his iPhone, that indispensable Thing, and order another pair, but that would leave him with two untenable choices: either worsen the planet's landfill problem by throwing a perfectly good sock into the black trash bin (not one of the Hundred Things, since it belonged to Riverside County) and dragging it down the dirt road, or hang on to the good sock to couple with one of his others when its mate wore out-which in the meantime would leave him stuck with a hundred and first Thing, so that was no choice at all.<br><br> Maybe if he biked into Idyllwild, he could buy a pair there and find a Goodwill center and donate the good sock. But in his heart he knew that would be phony solace, that someone else would just throw the widow sock in the garbage. The very thought reminded him that when the socks originally arrived he had read on the label that they were ten percent something called polypropylene.<br><br> Such were the problems on Charlie Waldo's mind when he heard the tires in the distance, turning off the asphalt and onto the dirt road that serviced his twelve acres of wooded mountainside.<br><br> Nobody but Rico the mail carrier had been on Waldo's property in the years since he'd moved here, and that only when a package wouldn't fit in the roadside box. He tried to remember whether the last time had been just over or just under a year ago, when Waldo had ordered a sack of feed for his chickens. He realized that was the last time he had spoken to anyone aloud, and he wondered whether he'd have to talk to Rico now, or whether a polite thank-you nod would be enough.<br><br> Then he worried what the mailman might be carrying, because the last thing Waldo needed was a Thing.<br><br> A cloud of dust blew into the clearing ahead of the mail truck, obscuring for a moment that it wasn't a mail truck at all but a sleek Porsche 911, metallic blue. Waldo absently dropped the holey sock into the wash bucket and stood to watch the coupe approach, squinting into the sun. The Porsche pulled to a stop thirty feet away, but he had to shield his eyes from the blowing dirt and the gleam, so he recognized her first by her voice.<br><br> "Jesus, Waldo."<br><br> When he did see her face, he realized that he hadn't thought about his own appearance in a very long time-a mirror was one of the last Things he'd shucked to get down to One Hundred-so he could only imagine what three years without a haircut or shave must have done to him.<br><br> And here was head-turning Lorena, who had to be thirty now, standing in front of him in the swirling dust in a leather jacket and ankle boots and designer jeans, thick black hair still past her shoulders, taking off her oversize designer sunglasses and shaking her head slowly with a cool smirk, as if none of it had ever happened, as if Waldo had never felt compelled to break his own heart by breaking hers.<br><br> She said it again: "Jesus, Waldo." Only now she was walking past him, past his pond, to his miniature cabin. It was just sixteen feet by eight, like some playhouse imitation of a folk Victorian, seated at the edge of a forest, straight out of a fairy tale but for the solar panels and satellite dish. "You live in this? Seriously?"<br><br> "The average American h-" His voice broke, unfamiliar to itself. He tried again. "The average American home puts out eighteen tons of greenhouse gases per year. A hundred twenty-eight square feet is enough for anyone."<br><br> "You got plumbing?"<br><br> "I harvest rainwater."<br><br> "In California?"<br><br> "And there's a spring if I need it."<br><br> "Damn." She looked the house up and down. "Well, if anyone's hard-ass enough to put himself through this shit . . ." She let the thought hang there and started inside uninvited.<br><br> "Hey!" He trotted after her.<br><br> Waldo had to wait in the doorway while she inspected the tiny space, a normal home ingeniously compacted to the size of a freshman dorm room, the wood unfinished, the shelves shallow, the walls crammed with cookware and cutlery and any other of the Hundred Things that could be hung. The kitchen was a two-burner stove set atop a waist-high closet with a small fridge and toaster oven, all squeezed next to a tiny sink fed by a ceramic water jug.<br><br> "My new place, I got a walk-in closet bigger than this. What's up here?" Lorena started up a ladder to a tiny loft.<br><br> "That's where I sleep." Waldo knew she'd note the folded blanket; even though he never had company, only neatness and precision made life in this space tolerable, and he was as unforgiving about housekeeping as about all other aspects of his life.<br><br> Still on the ladder, Lorena twisted and took in the whole tiny room. "Where's all your stuff?"<br><br> "I've divested. Got myself down to a hundred things. You'd be amazed what you can live without."<br><br> "Like a badge?" Waldo took the poke without response. She pressed. "You got a gun, at least?" He shook his head. "Jesus, Waldo." She climbed down and continued her inspection. "I see you still got a MacBook. Guess you could've answered an email." Before he could find an answer, she asked, "How much land this mansion sitting on?"<br><br> "Almost twelve acres."<br><br> "Show it to me."<br><br> She followed him outside and into the trees. Waldo, pulling on his windbreaker, tromped through the woods he knew so well he could manage in the dark, so shaken in the presence of another, even her, maybe especially her, that he pulled way ahead, incognizant of her struggle through the underbrush in three-inch heels. "The agency's grown," she said, having to raise her voice. "I've got three ops full-time, three more freelance. You surprised?"<br><br> "Not even a little." It was a compliment, but it rang as something else, as a conversation ender, all the more so when Waldo picked up his pace, extending his lead in silence. He didn't want to make conversation, didn't know how anymore. It felt wrong; it felt cheap. Anyway, he was allowed to be a bad host. He hadn't invited her. He hadn't invited anyone. That was the point.<br><br> When she spoke next he wasn't sure he heard her correctly-she was far behind now, and it seemed too random. It sounded like she said, "Alastair Pinch." He knew the name, of course, which he'd been seeing every day online in the headlines of the L.A. Times. But Waldo stayed away from those kinds of stories.<br><br> "Alastair Pinch?" she repeated, a little louder, and added, "The actor?"<br><br> "Who killed his wife."<br><br> "I guess you use that MacBook." She continued. "Maybe he killed her, maybe he didn't. Even he doesn't know-he's a blackout drunk."<br><br> She's on a case, Waldo thought, and wants help. But why would she need it? She's talented, she's got ops, she sure as hell can't be looking for his connections at the LAPD anymore. Unless she's not really looking for help, unless the help was an excuse to come. Either way, he wasn't interested. He walked even faster.<br><br> "Could you slow down?" she called. He stopped and turned. She resumed her pitch as she closed the gap. "His network's got a lot riding on him. They hired a lawyer: Fontella Davis."<br><br> "Fontella Davis. So he did kill her."<br><br> "It means the money's serious. And they're looking to hire a PI. This gig would jump me to the majors. Problem is, nobody's giving me that shot: woman, my age, midsize agency. But . . . if I could deliver the famous Charlie Waldo to work it with me . . ." She smiled at him. "You know these Hollywood types: always want to put a big name in it."<br><br> So that was it: she was here to make a business proposition, with the added benefit of showing Waldo that she'd survived and then some, that she was a success, and so completely over him that she could even handle working side by side. He realized he was glad for her on both counts. But he didn't want her getting the idea he wanted her here, so all he said was "I'm retired."<br><br> "From the force. Lot of ex-cops go PI. You'd be investigating a murder. What's the difference who signs the check?"<br><br> Waldo started walking again, this time dragging a little so she could keep up. "Difference is, cop's job is get the bad guy. PI's job is get the bad guy off."<br><br> "Unless he isn't the bad guy. You don't even have to put in for a license; you can work under mine." A sharp light, a reflection, cut through the trees. "What is that?"<br><br> She walked straight toward the light, ahead of Waldo now, into a clearing, where she found the elephant, a modernist sculpture of sheet metal, anomalously placed in the middle of nowhere. Lorena circled it, studying, then turned to Waldo for an explanation.<br><br> "They say an artist owned this land in the seventies." He laid a hand on the elephant's gleaming flank. "It's why I bought the property, actually. It spoke to me."<br><br> Lorena looked him straight in the eye, her lip curling into that sly, lopsided grin of hers, the one that said she knew everything about him and that started him thinking about some other things he'd gone without. She said, "Oh, I know why it spoke to you." She ran the fingers of one hand suggestively along the elephant's upturned trunk, never breaking eye contact. Waldo, nonplussed, wondered if her flirting was obtuse or if he was simply way out of practice. As if she could tell he needed the help, she explained. "One of those times we were supposedly 'broken up,' I was coming out of the art museum on Wilshire with a date and ran into you?" Waldo shook his head like he couldn't recall what she was talking about, even though he did. Lorena had ditched the guy on the spot and she and Waldo had all but run to the back seat of his truck in the parking garage. "Yeah," she said now, taunting, "try and play like you don't remember."<br><br> "What does that have to do with this?"<br><br> "The parking garage was right next to the La Brea Tar Pits. By the mammoths."<br><br> She started back into the woods, pleased with herself.<br><br> She'd ruffled him, the way only Lorena could. It had been a long time since he'd felt that, and he didn't like it. "Wait, wait, wait." Now he was the one scrambling to keep up with her. "First of all, this isn't a mammoth; it's an elephant. Second, are you saying I bought this property because I had some subconscious sexual memory prompted by this sculpture-"<br><br> "-which you walked me straight to, the minute I came to visit you-"<br><br> "-uninvited."<br><br> "Wasn't Detective Waldo's first rule 'There are no accidents'?" She kept walking.<br><br> He stopped, flummoxed, then started after her, insisting, "It's not a mammoth."<br><br> As they walked in silence back toward Waldo's cabin, side by side now, he didn't have to look at her to know she held on to that self-satisfied look the whole way. It was rattling and it was comfortable, which was worse. He wanted her to leave.<br><br> When they reached the clearing, she stopped walking and finally spoke. "So, this case: we'll go eighty-twenty, yours."<br><br> He knew he wouldn't take the deal but couldn't resist asking, "Why would you do that?"<br><br> "Because this is the biggest thing since O.J. It'll totally blow me up. And I've got too much marital. I want to branch out."<br><br> Waldo shook his head. "What would I even do with the money?"<br><br> "Buy a nicer hundred things."<br><br> "Pass."<br><br> She stood close to him, and Waldo wondered if she expected him to kiss her. He hoped not. He broke the moment and walked toward her car.<br><br> "You got any friends up here?" she asked. "You go into town? Anything?" Waldo shifted his weight, wondering what else he could do to hurry her into her car and back down the mountain. But she kept talking. "Lydell was a long time ago, Waldo. You don't have to keep punishing yourself. You don't have to live like this."<br><br> It pushed a button and his anger flashed, seeing her with her Porsche, everything he hated about the world, everything he'd rejected, and the words were out of his mouth before he had a chance to think about them. "You don't have to live like that."</p><h2>State v. Delaney: Third Edition Case File (NITA)</h2><p><p>Ardell Delaney, a professional baseball player, is charged with armed robbery.

In addition, it articulated the anxieties of a generation who saw these traditional fundamentals as no longer acceptable or necessarily credible.

T. Robinson</b> was a New Testament scholar who served as Bishop of Woolwich, England, and as Dean of Trinity College, University of Cambridge.</p></p><h2>Fascism Viewed from the Right</h2><p>In this book, Julius Evola analyses the Fascist movement of Italy, which he himself had experienced first-hand, often as a vocal critic, throughout its entire history from 1922 until 1945. Discussing - and dismissing - the misuse of the term &#39;fascism&#39; that has gained widespread acceptance, Evola asks readers not to allow the fact of Italy&#39;s defeat in the Second World War to distract us from making an objective analysis of the ideology of Fascism itself, since the defeat was the result of contingent circumstances and the personalities of those who led it, rather than flaws that were inherent in Fascism as an idea. Evola praises those aspects of Fascism which he believes to have been in accordance with the best traditions of European governance, in particular the Classical Roman tradition, while he remains critical of those aspects which ran contrary to this ideal, such as its socialist, proletarian and totalitarian tendencies, as well as what he saw as its petty moralism. Evola also distinguishes between the Fascism of the &#39;Twenty Years&#39; between 1922 and Mussolini&#39;s overthrow in 1943, and the &#39;Second Fascism&#39; of the Italian Social Republic, which he considered as much more problematic. He likewise criticises the Fascist racial doctrine for being based on false principles. Frequently quoting Mussolini&#39;s own words, Evola presents the core of the Fascist ideal, arguing that, for all its flaws, it remains superior to the political system which has since arisen to replace it. Julius Evola (1898-1974) was Italy&#39;s foremost traditionalist philosopher, as well as a metaphysician, social thinker and activist. Evola was an authority on the world&#39;s esoteric traditions and one of the greatest critics of modernity. He wrote extensively on the ancient civilisations of both East and West and the world of Tradition, and was also a critic of the political and spiritual movements of his own time from a traditional perspective.</p><p></p><h2>Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin</h2><p>Electrifying, highly acclaimed, and intensely personal, this new and updated version of Myra Friedman's classic biography of Janis Joplin teems with dramatic insights into Joplin's genius and into the chaotic times that catapulted her to fame as the legendary queen of rock. It is a stunning panorama of the turbulent decade when Joplin's was the rallying voice of a generation that lost itself in her music and found itself in her words.<br><br>From her small hometown of Port Arthur, Texas, to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, from the intimate coffeehouses to the supercharged concert halls, from the glitter of worldwide fame to her tragic end in a Hollywood hotel, here is all the fire and anguish of an immortal, immensely talented, and troubled performer who devoured everything the rock scene had to offer in a fatal attempt to make peace with herself and her era. Yet, in an eloquent introduction recently written by the author, Joplin emerges from her "ugly duckling" childhood as a woman truly ahead of her time, an outrageous rebel, a defiant outcast and artist of incomparable authenticity who, almost in spite of herself, became to so many a symbol of triumph over adversity.<br><br>This edition also contains an afterword detailing the whereabouts of a large and colorful cast of characters who were part of Joplin's life, as well as "We Remember Janis," a new chapter of poignant and affectionate anecdotes told by friends.</p><p>"One of the best books about a rock figure thus far...Buried Alive is unquestionably an accomplishment and it may well be the best portrait we'll have of Janis -- and past even that, it seems a study of the motivations of stardom as true as one is likely to achieve....I'd take Buried Alive over Norman Mailer's metaphysical Marilyn any day!" -- Rolling Stone<p>"Brilliant, marvelous, emotionally devastating...I don't think there's anything about Janis the book leaves untouched....I can almost hear her speak and, more relevantly, hear her laugh." -- New York Daily News</p><p>"Written with a sympathetic intelligence, at times fiercely lyrical, Buried Alive is an honest book about Joplin the idol....This is the best book yet about rock...."</p><b>Myra Friedman</b> has written on music and the arts and on contemporary cultural and social movements. Once a musician herself, she worked in the record industry and, in the late sixties, was Janis Joplin&#x2019;s publicist until the star&#x2019;s death in October 1970. Her biography of Janis Joplin is considered one of the most moving and significant books about a rock figure ever written. A landmark work when first published in 1973, it won the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award and received a National Book Award nomination.</p><h2>How to Train a Train</h2><p><b>Everything you need to know about finding, keeping, and training your very own pet train.</b><br><br>Finding advice on caring for a dog, a cat, a fish, even a dinosaur is easy.

Written in a style of short and effective meditations on prayer and contemplative spirituality, the concise reflections in this book address the heart of a soul's interior response to God. God's desire to draw souls to a deeper gift of themselves is inseparable from his desire to draw them into a deeper encounter with the sacred mystery of his presence.</p><p>Offering an abundance of insights into the value of silence, deep faith, trust and interior surrender to God, Father Haggerty also illumines the link between contemplation and love for poverty and the poor, and makes a strong appeal to the importance of prayer as the primary answer to the crisis of faith that afflicts so many people today.</p><p>The longing of souls for a deeper contemplative encounter with God is indeed a sign of the times. When it is nurtured properly and begins to burn as a passion of the soul, the love for prayer becomes a lifelong quest.</p></p><p><p><b>Fr. Donald Haggerty</b>, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York, has been a Professor of Moral Theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in New York and Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Maryland. He has a long association as a spiritual director for Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. He is the author of the book <i>Contemplative Provocations</i>.</p><p>"May Father Haggerty's reflections assist many to 'put out into the deep' of the life of prayer." <br> <strong>&#x2014; Raymond Cardinal Burke</strong></p><br><p>"A great invitation stirs within these pages to embark on the ultimate quest for God and holiness."<br> <strong>&#x2014; Fr.

Read this book, rejoice, and be reawakened to the Gospel."</p> --<strong>Matthew Levering, Ph.D.</strong>, Professor of Theology, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>"Fr. Haggerty provokes, encourages, and reassures Christians who struggle to remain faithful to prayer when the Lord seems to be silent. This work offers a very fresh, attractive, and compelling challenge, inviting readers to take heart, to expect more, and to give more to the Lord." --<strong>Sr. Sara Butler</strong>, M.S.B.T.<br><br>"Father Haggerty reveals that the most active of saints found the wellspring of their energies in the prayer of contemplation, by developing the habit of talking to God, intimately." --<strong>Fr. Romanus Cessario, O.P.</strong></p><h2>Grey Eminence</h2><p>The life of Father Joseph, Cardinal Richelieu&#39;s aide, was a shocking paradox. After spending his days directing operations on the battlefield, Father Joseph would pass the night in prayer, or in composing spiritual guidance for the nuns in his care. He was an aspirant to sainthood and a practising mystic, yet his ruthless exercise of power succeeded in prolonging the unspeakable horrors of the Thirty Years War. In his masterful biography, Huxley explores how an intensely religious man could lead such a life and how he could reconcile the seemingly opposing moral systems of religion and politics.</p><p>Aldous Huxley was born on 26th July 1894 near Godalming, Surrey. He began writing poetry and short stories in his early twenties, but it was his first novel, &#39;Crome Yellow&#39; (1921), which established his literary reputation. This was swiftly followed by &#39;Antic Hay&#39; (1923), &#39;Those Barren Leaves&#39; (1925) and &#39;Point Counter Point&#39; (1928) - bright, brilliant satires in which Huxley wittily but ruthlessly passed judgement on the shortcomings of contemporary society. For most of the 1920s Huxley lived in Italy and an account of his experiences there can be found in &#39;Along The Road&#39; (1925). The great novels of ideas, including his most famous work &#39;Brave New World&#39; (published in 1932 this warned against the dehumanising aspects of scientific and material &#39;progress&#39;) and the pacifist novel &#39;Eyeless in Gaza&#39; (1936) were accompanied by a series of wise and brilliant essays, collected in volume form under titles such as &#39;Music at Night&#39; (1931) and &#39;Ends and Means&#39; (1937). In 1937, at the height of his fame, Huxley left Europe to live in California, working for a time as a screenwriter in Hollywood. As the West braced itself for war, Huxley came increasingly to believe that the key to solving the world&#39;s problems lay in changing the individual through mystical enlightenment. The exploration of the inner life through mysticism and hallucinogenic drugs was to dominate his work for the rest of his life. His beliefs found expression in both fiction (&#39;Time Must Have a Stop&#39;, 1944 and &#39;Island&#39;, 1962) and non-fiction (&#39;The Perennial Philosophy&#39;, 1945, &#39;Grey Eminence&#39;, 1941 and the famous account of his first mescalin experience, &#39;The Doors of Perception&#39;, 1954. Huxley died in California on 22nd November 1963.&#34;Penetrating and vivid... This biography will rank amongst Huxley&#39;s best books. He never wrote better; he never hit upon a more interesting theme&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;A remarkable biography&#34; * Observer * &#34;Grey Eminence is lucid, scholarly and thoughtful.

The Vetterli rifle, named after its designer, Friedrich Vetterli, combined the features of the Winchester Model 1866 repeating rifle and the Dreyse needle fire rifle. In 1889, the Vetterli was replaced by the line of rifles based on the design of Rudolph Schmidt and the ammunition design of Eduard Rubin. The Schmidt-Rubin rifles remained in service with the Swiss military until 1958. They have become very popular collectible rifles. They are also extremely accurate and make some of the finest target rifles in the world. <p>Currently being imported in large numbers with a plentiful supply of ammunition, they are inexpensive and great fun to shoot. </p><p>The Swiss Magazine Loading Rifles, 1869-1958 is another in the North Cape Publications series of "For Collectors Only" books. It includes a short history of the development, production and use of both rifles as well as a detailed, part-by-part analysis that will enable the collector to determine the authenticity of his or her rifle or carbine. </p><p>The Vetterli was produced in sixteen various models and the Schmidt-Rubin in eight. Certain parts are interchangeable between models and the collector can use this book to determine if the parts on his or her rifle or carbine are correct by examining the codes, markings, design and finish of each part and comparing them to the descriptions in the book and to the serial number charts included. </p><p>In addition, chapters and appendices describe ammunition for both models, disassembly/assembly, repairs and maintenance and shooting as well as specific sections on markings, codes and serial numbers. </p><p>The Swiss Magazine Loading Rifles, 1869 to 1958 is the only book that has ever been written in English about these fine rifles.</p></p><p>Joe Poyer has written and published over 400 magazine articles and 35 books on antique and modern firearms and the modern military with twelve novels included in that number.

Because much of what Gerassi wrote about persists in today's struggles over gay and lesbian issues, his book still has much to tell us about how contemporary society reacts to, and misunderstands, homosexuality."&#x2015;Peter Boag<br><br>On the morning of November 2, 1955, the people of Boise, Idaho, were stunned by a screaming headline in the <i>Idaho Daily Statesman</i>, THREE BOISE MEN ADMIT SEX CHARGES. <i>Time</i> magazine picked up the story, reporting that a "homosexual underworld" had long operated in Idaho's staid capital city.

People still speak of it only as 'Dor�'s Don Quixote'." &#x2014; <i>Life and Reminiscences of Gustave Dor� <br></i>Dor� himself had something of Quixote's chivalry and spent an arduous life drafting impossible dreams; he knew fame as well as pain, disillusionment, and failure. At age 30 he was ready for Quixote and prepared to realize his dream of illustrating the world's great books.<br>Dor� never became the painter he yearned to be, but he came very close to realizing his desired intimacy with the classics. His sympathy with Cervantes' satire was so close that, of the numerous Quixote interpretations by many outstanding artists, Dor�'s has become the standard. The French translation of Cervantes that Dor� illustrated is forgotten; here is the memorable remnant of that work &#x2014; all 120 full-page plates, plus a selection of 70 characteristic headpiece and tailpiece vignettes.<br>As can be seen in the backgrounds, Dor� was ready professionally as well as emotionally for Quixote. He had traveled through Spain preparing an earlier work, and his graphic memory was as strong and indelible as that of another great Quixote interpreter, Picasso. From Sancho's village through Spanish hills and dry plateaus, in the Pyrenees and by the sea, in rural castles and Barcelona luxury, Dor� illuminated the seventeenth-century setting with a nineteenth-century acquaintance with the scene. Dor� was also a careful student of Renaissance costume and architecture; his minutiae, so copious, are invariably correct.<br>Captions written especially for this edition describe the action with reference to the original Spanish text, capturing high points of the story. But of course Dor� conveys it all in a picture: the famous windmill charge, traversing the Sierra Morena, battling the Knight of the White Moon, visions of giants, dragons, flaming lakes, and damsels, the Dulcinea never found, all in full-page wood engravings. Dor�'s marvelous penchant for ghostly effects in panoramic landscapes and seascapes finds large scope here, carefully engraved by one of the best of his longtime studio engravers, H. Pisano.<br>Dor�'s Man of la Mancha glows with the artist's own enchantment and humor. Artists and illustration aficionados will add this royalty-free volume to other Dover editions of Dor�'s works &#x2014; art he created to stand with great literature that now stands alone. Dor�'s Quixote indeed stands alone, unique among the knights and graphic castles in Spain.</p><p></p></p><p>French illustrator Gustave Dor� (1833-83) began his prolific career at the age of 15, and his dramatic engravings have exercised an incalculable influence over latter-day artists.

Like<i> The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>, it provides astonishing new perspectives on what science has uncovered about the powers of the mind and cellular memories. Dr. Schulz relates how her clients have used intuition to gain insight into the underlying meaning of their life challenges, stories that will inspire you to learn your own body's unique perceptive language. By learning to read your sensations, memories, and the signals of distress and disease, you can strengthen your mind-body consciousness and empower yourself to create a healthier, happier life.</p><p><i>Awakening Intuition</i> explores the idea that learning to use intuition and understanding its connection with memories, dreams, and healing can strengthen your body against disease and enrich your life. Using case studies, author Mona Lisa Shultz portrays her belief that emotions and diseases are linked, what areas of the body are affected by what kinds of feelings, and how we can tune in to the cause of an ailment.

On March 7, 1945, a small group of American infantrymen, engineers, and tank crews secured the Ludendorff Bridge that crossed the Rhine. The successful mission saved thousands of American lives and spearheaded the invasion of Nazi Germany.<br><br>The Bridge at Remagen is the detailed narrative of this surprising but crucial military action, one that stunned the German army. It is also the moving story of men who did not consider themselves heroes, but who performed magnificently under fire. In this amazing true story, Ken Hechler gives you the hour-by-hour account of brilliant military daring, human courage, and almost incredible luck that profoundly changed the course of the war.</p><p>Ken Hechler received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University and taught at Columbia College. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War II and, after service in the European Theater of Operations, rose to the rank of major. He assisted President Roosevelt in the preparation of the thirteen-volume Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hechler taught political science at Princeton, and later he accepted the post of special assistant in charge of research for President Truman. In 1958, Hechler became a congressman of West Virginia and served his state for eighteen years.I. The News Comes to West Point, Nebraska<br>March 7, 1945, was a busy evening at the Goldenrod Cafe in the wealthy little farm town of West Point, 75 miles northwest of Omaha, Nebraska. The school kids were just starting to pile into the booths along the edge of the walls for their evening round of milk shakes, and to take a couple of turns to the rhythm of the giant, rainbow-lighted jukebox. Above the chirp and chatter came the insistent ring of the telephone.<br><br>To Bill Schafer, the pudgy, bald-headed proprietor of the Goldenrod Cafe, the telephone was a nuisance. It always rang when he was busiest. His cooks and waitresses were constantly interrupting their work to take calls. The biggest annoyance was the long-distance call, which took so much time to get through from Omaha during wartime, and usually resulted in elaborate efforts to shush the gayer customers at the Goldenrod. So when Schafer shuffled to the phone on the evening of March 7, 1945, he was in bad humor when the operator said with authority: "Long distance for Mrs. Mary Timmermann, Omaha calling."<br><br>Schafer grunted uncomfortably: "Timmy, get this phone again. Make it short. You got lots of customers."<br><br>An ample, middle-aged lady wearily placed a wet rag on the edge of a table and plodded across to the phone. She was a little afraid of telephones, because her broken English was hard to understand and she had some difficulty figuring out what the other person was saying. She was also afraid because her two oldest sons were fighting in Germany, her pretty daughter was in the WAC, and her youngest son was threatening to run away from home to join the Army before he was old enough. A long-distance call could mean trouble.<br><br>Mrs. Timmermann, a German war bride from the first World War, had several brothers fighting in the German army in the second war. She was sick of war, sick of her back-breaking 11 a.m. to-midnight job at the Goldenrod, and jumpy and nervous about the safety of her sons and brothers who might be firing at each other at this very moment. She jabbered incoherently when a stern voice on the other end of the phone demanded: "Are you Mrs. Mary Timmermann, the mother of Second Lieutenant Karl H. Timmermann?"<br><br>The voice kept boring in, disregarding Mrs. Timmermann's frantic mixture of German and English.<br><br>Mrs. Timmermann feared the worst. She left the receiver dangling and jounced over to get Bill Schafer. "Bill, help me, it's something about Karl, I don't know what."<br><br>Schafer was not very sympathetic. He took the phone. The determined voice said:<br>"This is the Omaha World-Herald calling. Would you tell Mrs. Timmermann that her son, Second Lieutenant Karl H. Timmermann has just crossed the Remagen bridge, and he was the first officer over the bridge?"<br><br>Schafer, who had grown up along the Rhine, knew where the Remagen bridge was. He could guess that this was something pretty important, or else Omaha wouldn't be calling. But he wished that the voice wouldn't keep booming away as though Karl Timmermann had captured Adolf Hitler single-handed.<br><br>"Here, you take the phone, Timmy," said Schafer impatiently. "Karl is all right. He just crossed the Remagen bridge, that's all. Now talk to the man."<br><br>Mrs. Timmermann was still scared, and trembling. The voice kept saying: "Your son Karl has just crossed the Remagen bridge. You know what it means?"<br><br>"I know what it means to me: Is he hurt?"<br><br>"No, he's not hurt. But listen to this: Karl Timmermann was the first officer of an invading army to cross the Rhine River since Napoleon."<br><br>"Napoleon I don't care about. How is my Karl?"<br><br>The conversation was inconclusive. The World-Herald collected a few basic facts from Bill Schafer and Mrs. Schafer and then settled down to write a story about the heroism of Karl Timmermann.<br><br>Many telephones rang all over the country on the evening of March 7, 1945, as the word spread to families that there were many heroes at Remagen bridge.<br><br>For to the bridge at Remagen had come Americans from many parts of the land--a corporal named W. E. Richard from Decota, West Virginia, a shy, gangling butcher named Drabik from Toledo, a hard-driving general named Hoge from Lexington, Mo., a methodical engineer named Mott from Nashville, a sleepy-eyed tanker named Goodson from Pendleton, Indiana. . . . These along with Timmermann and many others equally courageous had brought off one of the war's most electrifying feats.<br>The big events of a war are confused things in the making. And after they are made, the passage of time tends to blur the original hazy outline of events into something unrecognizable. The story of the Remagen bridge has many versions. An infantryman may tell it one way, an engineer another, a tanker still another. The general commanding a huge army has a different view of it from the enlisted man in the ranks. The real story has honors enough for all--including many who never lived to see the light of day on March 7, 1945. And it begins long before that date, long before a few combat soldiers on their way to a town called Remagen unexpectedly caught sight of a lone bridge still spanning the waters of the Rhine.<br>II. How We Planned to Cross the Rhine<br>The town of Remagen is on the Rhine River midway between Cologne and Koblenz. It is an old Roman town, with a population of about 5,000. Tourists come to Remagen to stroll the riverbank, climb the grape-covered hillsides, and join in throaty songfests at the local cafes. But as a place from which to launch an attack across the Rhine, Remagen offers enormous difficulties.<br><br>One glance at a map would explain to any military man why Remagen is a terrible place to try a river crossing. The roads from the west are narrow. Even if troops succeed in crossing, mountains, forests, streams and ditches confront them--all conspiring against an attack--and poor secondary roads and rugged terrain unsuitable for tanks stretch eastward for a dozen miles, as far as the Bonn-Limburg autobahn.<br>The current at Remagen is swift and turbulent. The Ahr River, which swells to an angry torrent in the springtime, flows into the Rhine about one mile above the town. Between this junction and the town, the Rhine takes a sharp bend through a gorge and picks up speed through Remagen, where it is about seven hundred feet wide.<br><br>Directly opposite Remagen on the east bank looms a six-hundred-foot cliff of basalt whose sheer face is black against the sky, called the "Erpeler Ley." From the top of the cliff, or from the rude trails that lead to the summit, the observer has a commanding view of the countryside on both sides of the river and for ten miles in either direction.<br><br>North of Remagen rise the famous Siebengebirge ("Seven Mountains"), including the Drachenfels--where Siegfried slew the dragon. To the east and south are other heights. The rugged Westerwald area to the east, back from the Rhine, is peppered by thick, wooded areas and forbidding slopes and gullies which make natural tank traps. Several defunct volcanoes are prominent across the Rhine. This terrain not only is difficult for an attacker, but also provides excellent observation and protection for a defender.<br><br>At Remagen was a double-track railroad bridge, a little over 1,000 feet long, built at the end of World War I and named Ludendorff Bridge after Germany's wartime commander. The railroad, after crossing from the west, passed through a twelve-hundred-foot tunnel in the Erpeler Ley, and continued along the east bank toward the Ruhr. The bridge was important because it linked the Ruhr and the Ahr valley with the Eifel and Moselle regions. The townspeople resented it because it destroyed the beautiful view up the Rhine, but they were proud of its contribution to the war.<br><br>At the time of the Normandy landings, neither the American nor the German planners dreamed of a Rhine crossing at Remagen. The inch-by-inch fighting in the hedgerows during June and July was bloody and frustrating. But August of 1944 was a glorious month for the American Army in France, a month of sweeping movement through open country, with tanks in the lead, and the American military planners began to think seriously about how to cross the Rhine.<br><br>In August the unit that would be first to cross the Rhine--the 9th Armored Division--boarded the Queen Mary at New York and set out on a stormy voyage to Europe. Specifically, the hour was 7:45 a.m., the date was August 20, 1944, and it was the ship's seventeenth eastbound crossing. Second Lieutenant Karl Timmermann and his buddies had spent twelve days at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, boning up on ship-boarding techniques, taking physical examinations and making out last wills and testaments. They all had received passes for a last fling in New York. Timmermann stayed sober. He wrote to his wife at West Point, Nebraska, that he was planning to see a good movie, "Woodrow Wilson." It did not inspire him to make the world safe for democracy, but it gave some strength to his spirit and to his mental outlook toward the future.<br><br>Timmermann, an infantry platoon leader in Company A of the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion, hated the ocean. He liked little streams like the Elkhorn River back at West Point, which were ideal for swimming and fishing. He dreaded the ocean crossing.<br><br>The trip was longer and rougher than usual. While the ship zigzagged toward Scotland, big plans were being made and exciting developments occurred in France that were to influence the combat role of the voyagers. One day after the 9th Armored steamed out of New York harbor, a company of General Patton's foot soldiers in the 79th Division made a quiet and dramatic crossing of the Seine River. The night was rainy and all who were present testify it was the darkest night they had ever experienced. They found a wobbly footbridge alongside a dam across the Seine. Not a shot was fired. One nervous soldier lost his helmet, but there were no casualties.<br><br>Then came the liberation of Paris, that tumultuous and continuous celebration which seemed to go on all day and night for weeks. The flowers and the champagne and the kisses flowed on without interruption. And in the Allied ranks, optimism reigned supreme. From Paris, the tankers and their truck-borne infantry comrades were streaking toward the Siegfried Line and the Rhine.<br><br>Now the chief barrier to advance seemed to lie in the rear, for a critical shortage developed in supplies--especially gasoline. To be sure, the supplies were at Cherbourg and near the beaches, but when truck transport to the front took five days it became apparent that careful rationing was necessary. General Patton's tanks stormed ruthlessly forward without too much opposition until they were choked up short without gasoline. Rigid priorities were imposed, but they alone could not solve the basic problem of an overall shortage.<br><br>East of the Seine, the problem boiled down to who was going to push with the main effort--the British in the north, or the Americans in the south. Field Marshal Montgomery stressed the advantages of an advance through Holland which would open the way for a thrust across the north German plains directly to Berlin and victory. It was an intriguing prospect. Opening the vital port of Antwerp would ease the problem of supplies, and crushing the Ruhr, on which the enemy war machine depended, might bring about a German collapse.<br><br>General Omar Bradley, commanding an army group that included the First Army and General Patton's Third Army, had other ideas. He wanted to head for the Saar and the Rhine near Frankfurt. This route led directly through central Germany and would rob Germany of a coal-rich area.<br><br>As the debate between Montgomery and Bradley raged during August, nobody mentioned a town named Remagen on the Rhine. Montgomery wanted to left-hook far north of it, and Bradley to right-hook deep to the south. On the large-scale maps they were poring over, Remagen looked small and insignificant.<br><br>Late in August, General Eisenhower decided tentatively in favor of Montgomery's plan to make the main effort along the Channel coast. At the same time, he allowed Bradley's troops to close up to the Rhine and link up with General Devers' forces coming from the south. Only when the supply situation was well in hand would they launch the final push toward Berlin. The Eisenhower plan called for the first crossing of the Rhine to be made by Montgomery north of the Ruhr.<br><br>The American armies were still on the move August 27, when the Queen Mary docked in Scotland. There it was cold and clammy. "I put on my wool underwear today to keep my legs warm. They look like trapeze pants," Karl Timmermann wrote home. "I ate my three regular meals today; breakfast was the only one that came up." The top American planners had no special role in mind for Timmermann's comrades. They weren't due in France until early in October, and by then the war might be over for all practical purposes.<br><br>To follow up Montgomery's crossing of the Rhine, Bradley prepared his First Army to attack and cross the Rhine in the vicinity of Koblenz, Bonn and Cologne. This plan he unfurled in a field order dated September 10. Events quickly demonstrated that the planned crossing of the Rhine was premature. September proved to be a month of shattered dreams. Gasoline ran out. The tanks sputtered and ground to a halt. The Germans, after a long and harrowing retreat across France, suddenly found their second wind when they began fighting in defense of their homeland. The Siegfried Line and fortified cities like Metz were stubbornly held, and Field Marshal Model, a dedicated, fanatical improviser, injected a new fighting spirit into the tired German troops. On September 17, Montgomery made a brilliant gamble to cross the Rhine with daring paratroop drops at Arnhem and Nijmegen. But the German panzers closed in on them and methodically killed an appalling percentage of them. At the end of September, the Rhine seemed much farther away. President Roosevelt wrote to Winston Churchill that he had bicycled over most of the terrain "in the old days" and therefore was less optimistic than some of his field commanders about the ease of crossing the Rhine.<br><br>The 9th Armored spent most of September in England, training in tactical problems. The division was reequipped with new tanks and other vehicles and its equipment was in good shape. Then on September 28 it embarked at Weymouth on the south coast in an LST (landing ship, tank) for the English Channel crossing. Once again the infantrymen and tankers who were to figure in the first crossing of the Rhine were buffeted by seasickness.<br><br>France and Belgium were colder and rainier than England. There were bivouacs on damp ground, road marches and rain-swept trips by truck, then more chilly bivouacs, and finally, at the end of October, the green troops went into the line near Luxembourg. They didn't feel much like heroes, in the gooey mud and under the barren trees. Three days after going into the front lines for the first time, Karl Timmermann wrote back to Nebraska: "You know, military uniforms are pretty and smart, but really all they stand for are heartache, destruction and death, because a soldier is an instrument of war."<br><br>October and November were months of slow, painful and bloody progress through the treacherous H&#x178;rtgen Forest, and no spectacular gains were scored along the Allied front. In mid-October, First Army took Aachen. Then started a renewal of the debate between Montgomery and Bradley over where the next main thrust would be aimed in a November offensive. Bradley stressed the advantages of a two-pronged attack which would encircle the Ruhr, while Montgomery still felt that a single hammer blow north of the Ruhr was the most direct path to victory.

He wasn&#x2019;t cooperating. &#x201c;Come on, Mick. I&#x2019;m trying to get a Christmas card shot here,&#x201d; I wheedled, petting his nose. &#x201c;Can you hold it on for just one minute?&#x201d;<br><br>Mick nodded. This was Mick&#x2019;s special talent, but only one of the many things that made him lovable. He was able to convey, with one little humanlike gesture, the idea that he agreed with me, even approved of me. I had never encountered another dog who could nod like Mick.<br><br>I fastened the hat under his chin and took three quick snaps of him sitting in front of my shiny silver stove. I quickly reviewed the shots on my viewfinder. &#x201c;Perfect! Very cozy and domestic. Thanks, Mick.&#x201d; I took off the hat and scratched his ears; then I gave him a rawhide chew, which he took into the corner of the kitchen for further investigation.<br><br>I washed my hands and went to my extra-large refrigerator (a new purchase for which I&#x2019;d saved up funds for a year) and pulled out two huge trays of macaroni and cheese bake with crumbled potato chip topping. The casseroles smelled wonderful, and I realized I was hungry. Perhaps after I delivered them I could get myself some lunch. But before then I needed to get the food to John F. Kennedy Grade School, where Miss Jenny Braidwell taught third grade, and where her classroom full of students was convinced that their teacher was a terrific cook and baker. Miss Braidwell (who had once been my college roommate) made delicious, kid-friendly meals for all of her school events, and for many of them she was reimbursed by the school, since everyone at JFK liked Jenny Braidwell&#x2019;s cooking. No one knew, however, of Jenny&#x2019;s secret weapon: an old college pal who had made a clandestine agreement with Miss Braidwell to provide her with quality food&#x2014;and an enhanced reputation as a super-teacher&#x2014;in exchange for a generous sum of money.<br><br>At this point, all of my clientele were clandestine, but I was filling a niche. In the last two years I had learned a surprising fact: lots of people wanted credit for making food that they didn&#x2019;t have the time or the talent to make themselves. Some of those people had found me, or I had found them, and now I had a phone book full of clients. My father jokingly called this my &#x201c;Undercover Dish&#x201d; business.<br><br>I bundled the food carefully into the back of my aging Volvo, then went back into my hallway and called to Mick. &#x201c;Want to come along for deliveries?&#x201d; I asked. Normally Mick was my security guard, but today he only had eyes for his rawhide. I could hear him chewing it and making little&nbsp;satisfied growly sounds. Bing stopped singing, and my stereo, plugged into my iPod, selected another song from my shuffled playlist: &#x201c;Blue Christmas&#x201d;&#x2014;the original Elvis recording. I definitely didn&#x2019;t want to hear a sad love song, Christmas themed or otherwise. It was time to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, Mick. Party pooper. I&#x2019;ll see you in a while.&#x201d; I grabbed a little red bow off of my counter and clipped it onto my braid. Jenny had made it for me one Christmas. Her class had been making bows for moms and aunts and sisters, and she made one for me. Now I would wear it in tribute to Jenny and to the season. I locked the door of my little dwelling, which was actually an old gatehouse behind a much larger property, and climbed into the car; it smelled like cheesy heaven. Those little kids didn&#x2019;t know what joys awaited them.<br><br>I buckled in, flipped on the radio, and started backing out of the long driveway, headed for Dickens Street. A woman&#x2019;s voice on the Chicago &#x201c;light&#x201d; music station was speaking in soothing tones about the Christmas season. She informed me that it was 12:06. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s December sixteenth,&#x201d; she warned. &#x201c;Have you finished all of your holiday shopping? If not, remember that Dalby&#x2019;s has a full-service gift shop right next to the deli!&#x201d;<br><br>Dalby&#x2019;s was a Chicago-area grocery chain. I shopped there often, and if I didn&#x2019;t get my act together, I realized, I would probably end up doing all of my holiday shopping at a grocery store. This made me briefly sad, so I lifted my chin and changed to the classical station; there was only one in Chicago, but it was fantastic. Right now it was playing something from <i>The Nutcracker</i>, and I pounded an imaginary baton on my steering wheel as I turned on Breville Road and headed north. There was a Dalby&#x2019;s on the left side of the street, highlighting the commercial message from the radio. I hadn&#x2019;t been to that particular store for almost a month because of an unpleasant experience that had made me avoid it.<br><br>At the end of November I had stopped at Dalby&#x2019;s in the evening to pick up some ingredients for a client&#x2019;s dish. While I marched down the spice aisle in quest of a four-pepper blend that almost always sold out, I caught a glimpse of a dark-haired man pushing his cart past the mouth of the aisle. I shrank against the wall of spices, but he hadn&#x2019;t seen me. It was Jay Parker, a police detective with whom I&#x2019;d shared what turned out to be a one-evening event. I couldn&#x2019;t even call it a fling&#x2014;it was just some rather passionate kissing that had suggested we might have a future together. Parker had later cast me off because I lied to him (for very complicated reasons), and the whole thing had been humiliating. The last thing I wanted, ever again, was to see him.<br><br>I found my pepper and decided to forgo the rest of the things on my list. I raced to the checkout lane, glancing furtively behind me to see if Parker was there.<br><br>The girl at the register was outrageously chatty, asking if I liked the cold weather and if I had any fun plans for Christmas, and though I gave her terse answers and forced a smile, she continued to chat, her hands moving at a leisurely pace. I was on the verge of strangling her when she finally handed me the pepper in a small bag and said, &#x201c;Thanks for shopping at Dalby&#x2019;s. Have a nice day.&#x201d;<br><br>Normally I couldn&#x2019;t get one word&#x2014;or even eye contact&#x2014;out of a checkout person, but because I wanted to leave, Karma had made this one my best friend. I grabbed the bag from her and heard a voice say, &#x201c;Lilah.&#x201d;<br><br>I froze. It was Parker&#x2019;s voice; I peeked behind me to see&nbsp;that he was in line, two carts back. His startling blue eyes met mine, and they had the high-voltage effect they always did.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hi, Jay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>The little white-haired lady between us, along with the checkout girl (whose name tag said <i>Hi, I&#x2019;m Bonita</i>), watched without apology, openmouthed with wonder, probably at Parker&#x2019;s good looks.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m fine. Just super busy. In fact, I have to run. It was good seeing you, though,&#x201d; I said. I was talking far too rapidly, which aggravated me and clearly amused the white-haired woman.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you hold on for one second?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Can we talk in the parking lot, maybe?&#x201d;<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t bear to look at him anymore. My eyes dropped to his cart, which was full of healthy foods like fresh vegetables and lean chicken breasts&#x2014;and one giant tub of mint chocolate chip ice cream. &#x201c;That would be so great, but I have to run and let Mick out; he&#x2019;s been cooped up for hours.&#x201d;<br><br>I dared a glance upward. His eyes expressed cool blue disbelief, so I added, &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m expecting a long-distance call. And some visitors.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Lilah&#x2014;&#x201d; Parker said. A teenage boy came to pack up the white-haired woman&#x2019;s groceries, and he pushed me gently out of the way so that he could get to the bags.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, look at that&#x2014;I&#x2019;m in the way. It was great seeing you, Jay!&#x201d; I said far too loudly, and then I ran out of Dalby&#x2019;s and into the parking lot&#x2014;literally ran&#x2014;so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to encounter Jay Parker for even one second more. I thought I heard him call me once as I bolted toward the door, but I didn&#x2019;t turn back.<br><br>I sighed now as I drove past Dalby&#x2019;s. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Parker since that day, and I had shopped solely at Jewel since then in hopes that it would stay that way.<br><br>I was looking toward a happy Christmas holiday and a New Year in which I would establish a new me. I had a new job that I really liked, working for the best caterer in Pine Haven. I had a wonderful family and good friends, and I was about to visit one of those friends right now. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Jenny in person since November, either; she was always busy with school events, and I was always busy making or delivering secret food. But we managed to sneak in a lot of Facebook conversations and some deliciously snarky �e-mails and texts. She knew nothing of my brief <i>thing</i> with Parker, and I didn&#x2019;t plan to tell her. It hadn&#x2019;t even been complicated by sex&#x2014;just a lot of delicious kissing and some affectionate words. That tenuous relationship had proved to be an illusion. The fewer people who knew of my embarrassment, the better.<br><br>I pulled into the parking lot of JFK just as a light snow began to fall. It was lacy and delicate, like the kind inside a snow globe, and it lifted my spirits. I texted Jenny, informing her that the food was here. She wrote back, U R the best, and then, B rite out.<br><br>I sat in my car and waited, watching the snowflakes make their delicate journey from heaven to earth. Looking back, it&#x2019;s hard to remember what I was thinking as I stared through my windshield and contemplated the Christmas that was to come. It was one of those moments in life when I was so comfortably immersed in daily details that I felt no obligation to contemplate the bigger questions of life and death, the vastness of the universe, the mysteries beyond earthly comprehension. In retrospect it seems like that moment of&nbsp;quiet amid the snowflakes and empty cars was a last moment of innocence.<br><br>A second later Jenny appeared, along with a young man in a shirt and tie. He was cute in a studious and nerdy kind of way; he wore dark-rimmed glasses and his hair was messy, but probably not for fashionable reasons. I noted that Jenny seemed to enjoy speaking with him, and that her face was pink with pleasure after he leaned in and made some little joke to her. Then they were at my car. I had flipped my radio to the Christmas station, and this station, too, was playing &#x201c;Blue Christmas,&#x201d; but the Michael Bubl� cover instead of the Elvis version. Off it went, with a flick of my hand on the button.<br><br>I fell into professional mode, which was necessarily dishonest, in light of Jenny&#x2019;s companion. &#x201c;Hey, Jenn. Your mom sent these over because they were taking up too much room in her house after you made them. I said I&#x2019;d bring them since I live so close to her and you were right on my errand route. She said you would be baking them today and serving them at your Christmas party. Is that right?&#x201d; In reality, I had no idea where Jenny&#x2019;s mother lived.<br><br>Jenny nodded. &#x201c;Thanks so much, Lilah. Ross and I can take it from here.&#x201d;<br><br>Ross was smiling at Jenny instead of me; his eyes were devouring her. Wow. I could see the wedding cake already: <i>Congratulations, Ross and Jennifer</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you a teacher, as well?&#x201d; I asked as I slid out of the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>Ross stuck out a hand, and I shook it. &#x201c;Yes. Ross Peterson; I teach fifth grade. Jenny and I planned the lower grade Christmas party together. Between Jenny&#x2019;s delicious homemade food and the Christmas clown, the kids are going to be super excited. Plus we have our traditional visit from Santa. It&#x2019;s going to be a great party.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a Christmas clown?&#x201d; I asked, opening the back hatch.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s just an entertainer we found. She sings some holiday songs with them, and does a little magic and juggling and joke telling. It&#x2019;s a really cute and fun act. Then Santa comes in and gives out presents. They&#x2019;re with the clown right now, actually, in the school gym. She&#x2019;ll be with them for about an hour while Santa is still getting his makeup on. He&#x2019;s an actor, so he always makes a big deal about getting the look just right. So he goes second; now he&#x2019;s just waiting for her to be finished. The kids are at Level Ten excitement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fun. And where did you find Santa?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Jenny slid out one of the trays and held it carefully in front of her. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s Brad Whitefield. He&#x2019;s a friend of someone on the staff, so he got selected. He&#x2019;s an actor, like Ross said. He&#x2019;s done it the last few years. I guess actors have to take work where they can get it, right?&#x201d;<br><br>Ross had the other tray now, and I closed the hatch. &#x201c;Well, you guys enjoy the party,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;We will,&#x201d; Jenny said, blowing me a kiss. &#x201c;And Lilah, I wrote a note to my mom. Could you bring it to her when you see her today? I left it in a card on your front seat.&#x201d;<br><br>That meant my money, of course. People came up with all sorts of creative ways to slip me my pay. &#x201c;Sure I can,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>I watched them move carefully with the giant pans. I had warned Jenny that I would need those back within two days&#x2014;lots of people wanted to &#x201c;make&#x201d; party food during this season, and I had very little time to put it together now that I was catering full-time most days. My boss, who had been let in on my little secret, was generally kind about letting me make deliveries before I came into work; today she had given me the whole morning off.<br></b></p><h2>A Week in the Life of Rome (A Week in the Life Series)</h2><p><strong>In first-century Rome, following Jesus comes at a tremendous social cost.</strong> An urbane Roman landowner and merchant is intrigued by the Christian faith&#x2015;but is he willing to give up his status and lifestyle to join the church? Meanwhile his young client, a catechumen in the church at Rome, is beginning to see just how much his newfound faith will require of him. <em>A Week in the Life of Rome</em> is a cross section of ancient Roman society, from the overcrowded apartment buildings of the poor to the halls of the emperors. Against this rich backdrop, illuminated with images and explanatory sidebars, we are invited into the daily struggles of the church at Rome just a few years before Paul wrote his famous epistle to them. A gripping tale of ambition, intrigue, and sacrifice, James Papandrea's novel is a compelling work of historical fiction that shows us the first-century Roman church as we've never seen it before.</p><p>James L. Papandrea (PhD, Northwestern University) is professor of church history and historical theology at Garrett-Evangelical Seminary at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He is the author of <em>The Earliest Christologies</em>, <em>The Trinitarian Theology of Novatian of Rome</em>, and <em>Reading the Early Church Fathers</em>. He studied Roman history at the American Academy in Rome, Italy."A marvelous read!" (Rodney Stark, codirector, Institute for Studies of Religion, Baylor University)<br><br>"Jim Papandrea has done it again. An eminent scholar and theologian of the church fathers, who has also written about Christianity in popular cinema, blends his love of history with his passion for narrative tales. This unique work punctuates a wonderful fictional story with pithy lessons about the life of early Christians. Dr. Papandrea's style makes this a great read for anyone from age twelve to 112. Bravo!" (Anthony Gill, author of The Political Origins of Religious Liberty)<br><br>"James L. Papandrea's imaginative narrative builds on a substantial amount of strong historical scholarship, yet it is presented in a fresh and unique way. Contemporary readers will sense both continuity and discontinuity between the earliest church and their own lives. When looking back at first-century Christians in Rome, current practices of the faith amid modern cultural challenges appear both familiar and strange at the same time. One does not need to agree with every aspect of Papandrea's imaginative narrative to benefit greatly from his historical recreation. I occasionally teach a course in Rome and this is now a required textbook; any Christian visiting this great city should read this book before they go!" (Kelly M. Kapic, professor of theological studies, Covenant College)</p><h2>Dear Yeti</h2><p><p><b>A sweet and whimsical story of a perfect kid-sized winter adventure, <i>Dear Yeti</i> is the debut picture book of an author/illustrator to watch.</b></p><p>Two young hikers set out to look for Yeti one day, and with the help of a bird friend, they trek further and further into the woods, sending letters to coax the shy creature out of hiding. But as their trip goes on, the hikers find that they have not prepared very well, and though their morale is high, food supplies are low, the forest is getting darker, and a snowstorm looms. Luckily Yeti is a friend they can rely on, and though he's not ready to come out of hiding, he sneakily finds a way to get the hikers exactly what they need when they need it. </p><p>"...a sweet-natured story with a subtle, irresistible narrative momentum, and it&#x2019;s beautifully drawn as well." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p><b>James Kwan</b> is a recent graduate of Pratt Institute. <i>Dear Yeti</i> is his picture book debut.K-Gr 2&#x2014;A pair of young explorers venture into the frozen wilderness in search of the yeti. Although they experience setbacks along the way, the boys persist as they determine their potential friend's furry whereabouts. Their journey is chronicled in a series of brief notes to the infamous beast. "Dear Yeti, Morale is still high, but food supplies are low. Hikers." Though their paths do not initially cross, the child hikers' request for help is recognized when Yeti leaves them food and shelter along their journey. Bright blue backgrounds emphasize the spareness of the crisp outdoors. A little bird carries the letters as a means of communication between the parties and serves as a welcome ear when perched on Yeti's shoulders. Yeti makes his intentions clear when he approaches a grizzly bear with a declarative request: "Please don't eat my new friends." The sweet and fitting conclusion conveys a comforting resolution as Yeti carries the young hikers home, where they find a final letter from their gentle giant waiting for them.

With digital tools at their disposal, the majority of designers create while sitting at their computer screens. Attitudes are changing, however. Eager to push the boundaries of their creative processes and spurred by a sense of being disconnected from their briefs, today&#x2019;s designers seek a greater and more immediate connection with their projects. There is no better way to stimulate the imagination than by learning to draw what one sees, and in the fluid, living world of landscape architecture, it is particularly important. <p>This essential publication reintroduces the importance of learning to &#x201c;see by hand,&#x201d; to visualize large-scale design schemes and explain them through drawing, before using the digital tools that are time- and cost-efficient building solutions. Combining traditional drawing techniques with those from CAD rendering, <em>Drawing for Landscape Architecture</em> guides practitioners from their very first impression.

The epic benefits from being collected here as a single set of inspired weirdness.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a complex, multi-layered narrative with a classic unreliable protagonist.... Burns&#x2019; art is sensational. The images from Johnny&#x2019;s story are genuinely disturbing on every level. As always, his characters tap into various archetypes of American youth and family life, but with a sinister edge showing darkness behind the American dream. Burns&#x2019; work is seductive, disquieting and original and if you don&#x2019;t already have the separate volumes, this is a great chance to read the story for the first time.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2014;The Quietus</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Comic book writer and artist Charles Burns is master of the creepy, dislocated narrative.... It feels trite to bring up David Lynch comparisons when they're used to lend mystique to artists who have the slightest tickle of the strange, but in Burns' case a Lynch comparison seems accurate; his work shares much with the directors output, from the thickly inked 50s style, to the weird cyclical conversations and unforgiving penchant for a plot lurch.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2014;Ransom Note</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;On one hand, you have the story of Doug, a young man who watched his father slowly die and takes that into all of his relationships and attempts at art. But the book also contains this story of Johnny 23, another young, naive man who ends up in an alien city and has to figure out how to survive....These two stories brilliantly align to create one cohesive narrative about something so simple as our search for happiness.&#x201d;<b> <i>&#x2014;Panel Patter</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <i>&#x201c;</i>As much grotesque fun as it was reading these books instalment by instalment, <i>Last Look</i> is absolutely the way it should be read.

Surprisingly, many of the best ones are "self-working," meaning they do not require unusual dexterity or long hours of practice. This excellent guidebook, written by one of today's foremost authorities on magic, presents 70 of the best, most amazing self-working rope tricks ever devised &#x2014; tricks that amateur magicians can master in a short time.<br>After a brief introduction and a section devoted to acquiring and preparing the proper ropes, Karl Fulves begins the book by introducing rope tricks based on simple overhand knots, slip knots and square knots. These are followed by such tricks as the "Vishnu Rope Mystery" and the "Hindu Turban Mystery" in the chapter entitled "Cut-and-Restored Rope." In "Ropes That Think" he demonstrates such fascinating maneuvers as "Liar's Ropes" and "S�ance." You'll also learn how to do a one-hand figure eight, perform a "double-ring ceremony" and make an endless chain.<br>Novice&nbsp;magicians as well as veterans can learn these foolproof tricks quickly and easily with Karl Fulves' clearly worded instructions and over 400 step-by-step illustrations. Along with the specifics of how to perform each trick, Mr. Fulves provides helpful phrases and bits of patter to help readers present each routine with a professional flourish.</p><p>Karl Fulves is one of the most respected authorities in the field of magic.

Why is He Important?: An Invitation to the New Testament (The Come &amp; See Series)</h2><p>Finally, an introduction to the New Testament for everyone! <br><br>Focusing on the most basic Christian message, <i>Who Is Jesus? Why Is He Important?</i> leads readers step-by-step through the entire New Testament. One of the world's leading authorities on Scripture, Father Harrington artfully synthesizes the best of contemporary scholarship, placing it in dialogue with deeply personal and pastoral concerns. No matter how familiar you are with the New Testament&#x2015;from beginner to professional&#x2015;this is a reliable guide that seeks honest answers to complex questions.</p><p>Daniel J. Harrington, SJ (1940&#x2013;2014), was professor of New Testament at the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry. He was the author of a number of books, including How Do Catholics Read the Bible? and, with James F. Keenan, Jesus and Virtue Ethics.Harrington, professor of New Testament at the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge, Mass., focuses on the most basic of all Christian doctrines: the identity of Jesus. He leads readers step-by-step through the entire New Testament, outlining each book and using literary, historical and theological criticism to interpret what it tells us about Jesus. For example, Harrington breaks the Gospel of John into three sections: "The Word of God (John 1-4)", "Jesus and 'the Jews' (John 5-12)" and "The Son of God (John 13-21)." Who is Jesus according to John, then? Harrington shows readers that the Jesus in John's Gospel is the Word of God and the Son of God; Jesus is both the revealer sent by God and God's revelation. Harrington concludes the section by pointing out that John says the proper response to Jesus is to "to love God and one's neighbor." Harrington asserts that by prayerfully using this reflective method on the New Testament texts, readers can discover who Jesus is and why He is important to their lives today. This is a reliable and accessible introduction to Jesus and the New Testament. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bible Cure for Candida and Yeast Infections: Ancient Truths, Natural Remedies and the Latest Findings for Your Health Today (New Bible Cure (Siloam))</h2><p><b>OVER 3 MILLION BIBLE CURE BOOKS SOLD</b><br><b>FROM THE<i> NEW YORK TIMES</i> BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF <i>THE SEVEN PILLARS OF HEALTH</i> AND <i>I CAN DO THIS DIET</i></b><br><br> How can tiny single-celled organisms in the body become such a problem?<br><br> Explore your body's defenses as it battles for balance.

Guadalupe Vald�s examines what appears to be a lack of interest in education by Mexican parents and shows, through extensive quotations and numerous anecdotes, that these families are both rich and strong in family values, and that they bring with them clear views of what constitutes success and failure. The book&#x2019;s conclusion questions the merit of typical family intervention programs designed to promote school success and suggests that these interventions&#x2015;because they do not genuinely respect the values of diverse families&#x2015;may have long-term negative consequences for children.</p> <p><em>Con Respeto</em> will be a valuable resource in graduate courses in foundations, ethnographic research, sociology and anthropology of education, multicultural education, and child development; and will be of particular interest to professors and researchers of multicultural education, bilingual education, ethnographic research methods, and sociology and anthropology of education.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;This rich and absorbing study of Mexican parents in border communities leads to more complex, rather than single-minded, solutions to school success. Vald�s sees to the center of things and deftly questions the merit of typical educational interventions aimed at promoting school success.... these interventions, grounded in mainstream values, do more harm than good. They do not show respect for deeply ingrained familistic values&#x2014;the cultural capital that immigrant parents bring with them on their backs and in their hearts from their homeland; and they devalue the social and linguistic competence of immigrant parents and their children....Vald�s does not provide solutions. She does, however, lead the search with her strong but cautious narrative voice for a sufficiently complex and multi-leveled understanding of the challenges facing families who move across borders as immigrants.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;From the Foreword by Carol Stack<br> </p><p><strong>Guadalupe Vald�s</strong> is a Professor in the School of Education and in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Stanford University.</p></p><h2>Legal Ethics in the Practice of Law</h2><p>When <i>Legal Ethics in the Practice of Law</i> was first published in 1995, it was believed to be the first core-course law school text written by practicing lawyers.

The book starts by putting STEM in context, as the early chapters outline the challenges facing STEM education, draw lessons from the Sputnik moment of the 1950s and 1960s, and contrast contemporary STEM with other education reforms. The author then explores appropriate roles for the federal government as well as states, districts, and individual schools. Finally, the book offers several ideas you can use to develop actual action plans for STEM. Throughout the book, author Rodger W. Bybee puts an emphasis on both thinking and acting. That s why The Case for STEM Education is a must-read for leaders at all levels: national and state policymakers, state-level educators responsible for STEM initiatives, college and university faculty who educate future STEM teachers, local administrators who make decisions about district and school programs, and teachers who represent STEM disciplines.</p><p>Although clearly a key text for anyone teaching or involved in STEM education in the U.S., there is probably insufficient relevant information for most teachers outside the U.S. ... However, this book could be useful for anyone with specific interests in developing or researching aspects of STEM education, including historical, comparative or global studies. --School Science Review March 2014</p><h2>Spanish Translated Milady Standard Esthetics: Fundamentals</h2><p>Milady Standard Esthetics Fundamentals, 11th edition, is the essential source for basic esthetics training.

She served as Guest Curator for the exhibition George Inness and the Visionary Landscape (2003-04) and is an Associate Professor of Art History at Marymount Manhattan College, New York.Inspired landscape painter George Inness (1825-94) was born in New York State's beautiful Hudson Valley and could easily have been part of the world-renowned Hudson River School. Instead, as Bell argues so persuasively in this rare, invaluable, and luminously illustrated monograph, Inness was far more concerned with metaphysics than with representational depictions of nature. Sojourns in Europe brought him into sympathy with the "emotionalism and painterly practices of the Barbizon School," Bell writes, but the most crucial influence on his later work was his immersion in the writings of Swedenborg, which inspired him to paint landscapes emblematic of the Swedenborgian vision of "spiritual influx," that is, the infusion of divinity into nature. Psychologist and philosopher William James also shaped Inness' meditative aesthetics with his vision of consciousness as a "stream of thought" and his observation of how mystical experiences "soften nature's outlines and open out the strangest possibilities and perspectives." The latter provides a perfect description for Inness' transcendent landscapes--gorgeous and radiant scenes that embody life's interconnectivity, mystery, timeless beauty, and untarnished hope. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Further extrapolating on the ideas in his wildly popular viral youtube talk to the Heritage Foundation, that has received over 600k hits, Evan Sayet uses his signature wit in this new book to ask thought- provoking questions during these turbulent economic and social times. And he provides the reader with some surprising answers. Andrew Breitbart said that Evan Sayet's Heritage Foundation Speech was 'one of the five most important conservative speeches ever given.' That speech was the foundation for this book. How did the song "Imagine" by John Lennon become the perfect symbol of liberal thinking? Why does Bruce Springsteen dub "pain" as the wages of toil and hard work? What&#x2019;s the Democrats&#x2019; beef with God? What do they have against the Jews of Israel? Why do they want abortion to be commonplace and frequent? Why does the Modern Liberal &#x2013;the dominant force in today&#x2019;s Democratic Party and in so much of today&#x2019;s popular culture &#x2013; seem to always side with evil over good, wrong over right and the behaviors that lead to failure over those that lead to success?

Bonhoeffer&#39;s theological brilliance, committed discipleship, ecumenical insight, and courageous participation in the struggle against fascism have profoundly shaped contemporary Christian understanding and action. In John W. de Gruchy&#39;s estimate, had Bonhoeffer lived &#34;he might have dominated the theological scene in the second half of the twentieth century in succession to Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Tillich. As it was, he became the paradigmatic martyr-theologian&#34; for our time. In this new biography, Christiane Dietz masterfully portrays the interconnectedness of Bonhoeffer&#39;s life and thought, theology and politics, discipleship, witness, and resistance, tracing the path from his childhood to his imprisonment and execution. Brief, lucid, and imminently accessible, Tietz&#39;s new account brings Bonhoeffer&#39;s story and work to life in a vivid retelling, unfolding his important and widely read texts, and including new, previously unseen pictures.</p><p>Christiane Tietz is professor of systematic theology at the University of Zurich and chairperson of the German language section of the International Bonhoeffer Society. She has published widely on Bonhoeffer."This study of Bonhoeffer demonstrates a masterful grasp on the history and the context of Bonhoeffer's theological corpus. In <i>Theologian of Resistance</i>, Christiane Tietz takes readers on a biographical journey with Bonhoeffer, from his childhood to his untimely death at the hands of the Nazis. Students encountering Bonhoeffer for the first time, and those very familiar with Bonhoeffer, will find this to be a very rewarding book. In addition to reading Bonhoeffer's theology contextually, Tietz offers readers a brief interaction with the historical, global reception of Bonhoeffer studies. This is a must read for any serious study of Bonhoeffer." --Reggie L. Williams, McCormick Theological Seminary<br><br>"Christiane Tietz has filled an important niche in the literature on Dietrich Bonhoeffer by writing a short, accessible introduction to this towering figure of the twentieth century. . . . Tietz has a deep and respectful knowledge of her subject, and selects carefully from both well-known and more obscure writings in such a way that provides texture to Bonhoeffer's public persona. Embedded in the biographical narrative are synopses of some his most criticaland complexideas. Greatly enabled by the translation of Victoria Barnett, this volume introduces Bonhoeffer's theological contributions to those beyond religious and academic communities." --Katie Day,| Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia<br><br>"sAs the title suggests, Christiane Tietz's new biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer revolves around three key elements: his life, his thought, and their culmination in his resistance to both the nazification of the German churches and the Hitler regime itself. Employing extensive quotations from Bonhoeffer's writings, Tietz keeps Bonhoeffer's ideas and actions continuously in conversation with one another. The result is a wonderfully concise biography that will no doubt become the primary introduction to Bonhoeffer." --Kyle Jantzen, Ambrose University</p><h2>Dean and Me: (A Love Story)</h2><p><b>In a memoir by turns moving, tragic, and hilarious, Jerry Lewis recounts with crystal clarity every step of his fifty-year friendship with Dean Martin.&nbsp;</b><br><br>They were the unlikeliest of pairs&#x2014;a handsome crooner and a skinny monkey, an Italian from Steubenville, Ohio, and a Jew from Newark, N.J.. Before they teamed up, Dean Martin seemed destined for a mediocre career as a nightclub singer, and Jerry Lewis was dressing up as Carmen Miranda and miming records on stage. But the moment they got together, something clicked&#x2014;something miraculous&#x2014;and audiences saw it at once. <br><br> Before long, they were as big as Elvis or the Beatles would be after them, creating hysteria wherever they went and grabbing an unprecedented hold over every entertainment outlet of the era: radio, television, movies, stage shows, and nightclubs. Martin and Lewis were a national craze, an American institution. The millions flowed in, seemingly without end&#x2014;and then, on July 24, 1956, ten years after it all started, it ended suddenly. After that traumatic day, the two wouldn&#x2019;t speak again for twenty years. And while both went on to forge triumphant individual careers&#x2014;Martin as a movie and television star, recording artist, and nightclub luminary (and charter member of the Rat Pack); Lewis as the groundbreaking writer, producer, director, and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies&#x2014;their parting left a hole in the national psyche, as well as in each man&#x2019;s heart.<br><br> In <i>Dean &amp; Me</i>, Lewis makes a convincing case for Martin as one of the great&#x2014;and most underrated&#x2014;comic talents of our era. But what comes across most powerfully in this definitive memoir is the depth of love Lewis felt for his partner, and which his partner felt for him: truly a love to last for all time.</p><p>JERRY LEWIS and Dean Martin sandwiched sixteen money-making films in between nightclub engagements, recording sessions, radio shows, and television bookings during their ten-year partnership. Over the following years Lewis remained in the spotlight as the groundbreaking creator and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies, and scored triumphs in stage appearances in Europe, where he has been hailed as one of the greatest director<b>-</b>comedians of the twentieth century. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and has received numerous other honors for his tireless efforts in the fight against the fourty neuromuscular diseases. <br>JAMES KAPLAN has written novels, essays, and reviews, as well as over a hundred major profiles for many magazines, including<i> The New Yorker, </i>the<i> New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Entertainment Weekly,</i> and <i>New York.</i> In 2002 Kaplan coauthored the autobiography of John McEnroe, <i>You Cannot Be Serious,</i> which was an international bestseller (and #1 on the<i> New York Times</i> list). He lives in Westchester, New York, with his wife and three sons.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>In the age of Truman, Eisenhower, and Joe McCarthy, we freed America. For ten years after World War II, Dean and I were not only the most successful show-business act in history&#x2013;we were history. <br><br>You have to remember: Postwar America was a very buttoned-up nation. Radio shows were run by censors, Presidents wore hats, ladies wore girdles. We came straight out of the blue&#x2013;nobody was expecting anything like Martin and Lewis. A sexy guy and a monkey is how some people saw us, but what we really were, in an age of Freudian self-realization, was the explosion of the show-business id.<br> <br>Like Burns and Allen, Abbott and Costello, and Hope and Crosby, we were vaudevillians, stage performers who worked with an audience. But the difference between us and all the others is significant. They worked with a script. We exploded without one, the same way wiseguy kids do on a playground, or jazz musicians do when they&#x2019;re let loose. And the minute we started out in nightclubs, audiences went nuts for us. As Alan King told an interviewer a few years ago: &#x201c;I have been in the business for fifty-five years, and I have never to this day seen an act get more laughs than Martin and Lewis. They didn&#x2019;t get laughs&#x2013;it was pan�demonium. People knocked over tables.&#x201d; <br><br>Like so many entertainment explosions, we happened almost by accident. <br><br>***<br><br>It was a crisp March day in midtown Manhattan, March of 1945. I had just turned nineteen, and I was going to live forever. I could feel the bounce in my legs, the air in my lungs. World War II was rapidly draw�ing to a close, and New York was alive with excitement. Broadway was full of city smells&#x2013;bus and taxi exhaust; roast peanuts and dirty-water hot dogs; and, most thrilling of all, the perfumes of beautiful women. Midtown was swarming with gorgeous gals! Secretaries, career girls, society broads with little pooches&#x2013;they all paraded past, tick-tock, tick-tock, setting my heart racing every ten paces. I was a very young newly�wed, with a very pregnant wife back in Newark, but I had eyes, and I looked. And looked. And looked. <br><br>I was strolling south with my pal Sonny King, heading toward an appointment with an agent in Times Square. Sonny was an ex-prize-fighter from Brooklyn trying to make it as a singer, a knock-around guy, street-smart and quick with a joke&#x2013;kind of like an early Tony Danza. He prided himself on his nice tenor voice and on knowing everybody who was anybody in show business. Not that his pride always matched up with reality. But that was Sonny, a bit of an operator. And me? I was a Jersey kid trying to make it as a comic. My act&#x2013;are you ready for this?&#x2013; was as follows: I would get up on stage and make funny faces while I lip-synched along to phonograph records. The professional term for what I did was <i>dumb act</i>, a phrase I didn&#x2019;t want to think about too much. In those days, it felt a little too much like a bad review. <br><br>You know good-bad? Good was that I was young and full of beans and ready to take on the world. Bad was that I had no idea on earth how I was going to accomplish this feat. And bad was also that I was just eking out a living, pulling down $110 a week in a good week, and there weren&#x2019;t that many good weeks. On this princely sum I had to pay my manager, Abner J. Greshler, plus the rent on the Newark apartment, plus feed two, about to be three. Plus wardrobe, candy bars, milk shakes, and phonograph records for the act. Plus my hotel bill. While I was working in New York, I stayed in the city, to be close to my jobs&#x2013;when I had them&#x2013;and to stick to where the action was. I&#x2019;d been rooming at the Bel�mont Plaza, on Lexington and Forty-ninth, where I&#x2019;d also been perform�ing in the Glass Hat, a nightclub in the hotel. I got $135 a week and a room. <br><br>Suddenly, at Broadway and Fifty-fourth, Sonny spotted someone across the street: a tall, dark, and incredibly handsome man in a camel&#x2019;s-hair coat. His name, Sonny said, was Dean Martin. Just looking at him intimidated me: <i>How does anybody get that handsome?</i> <br><br>I smiled at the sight of him in that camel&#x2019;s-hair coat. <i>Harry Horseshit</i>, I thought. That was what we used to call a guy who thought he was smooth with the ladies. Anybody who wore a camel&#x2019;s-hair overcoat, with a camel&#x2019;s-hair belt and fake diamond cuff links, was automatically Harry Horseshit. <br><br>But this guy, I knew, was the real deal. He was standing with a shorter, older fellow, and when he saw Sonny, he waved us over. We crossed the street. I was amazed all over again when I saw how good-looking he was&#x2013;long, rugged face; great profile; thick, dark brows and eyelashes. And a suntan in March! How&#x2019;d he manage that? I could see he had kind of a twinkle as he talked to the older guy. <i>Charisma</i> is a word I would learn later. All I knew then was that I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off Sonny&#x2019;s pal. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Dino!&#x201d; Sonny said as we came up to them. &#x201c;How ya doin&#x2019;, Lou?&#x201d; he said to the older man. <br><br>Lou, it turned out, was Lou Perry, Dean&#x2019;s manager. He looked like a manager: short, thin-lipped, cool-eyed. Sonny introduced me, and Perry glanced at me without much interest. But Sonny looked excited. He turned to his camel-coated friend. &#x201c;Dino,&#x201d; Sonny said, &#x201c;I want you to meet a very funny kid, Jerry Lewis.&#x201d; <br>Camel-Coat smiled warmly and put out his hand. I took it. It was a big hand, strong, but he didn&#x2019;t go overboard with the grip. I liked that. I liked <i>him</i>, instantly. And he looked genuinely glad to meet me. <br><br>&#x201c;Kid,&#x201d; Sonny said&#x2013;Sonny called me Kid the first time he ever met me, and he would still call me Kid in Vegas fifty years later&#x2013;&#x201c;this is Dean Martin. Sings even better than me.&#x201d; <br><br>That was Sonny, fun and games. Of course, he had zero idea that he was introducing me to one of the great comic talents of our time. I cer�tainly had no idea of that, either&#x2013;nor, for that matter, did Dean. At that moment, at the end of World War II, we were just two guys struggling to make it in show business, shaking hands on a busy Broadway street corner. <br><br>We made a little chitchat. &#x201c;You workin&#x2019;?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>He smiled that million-dollar smile. Now that I looked at him close up, I could see the faint outline of a healing surgical cut on the bridge of his nose. Some plastic surgeon had done great work. &#x201c;Oh, this &#x2018;n&#x2019; that, you know,&#x201d; Dean said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on WMCA radio, sustaining. No bucks, just room.&#x201d; He had a mellow, lazy voice, with a slightly Southern lilt to it. He sounded like he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world, like he was knockin&#x2019; &#x2019;em dead wherever he went. I believed it. Little did I know that he was hip-deep in debt to Perry and several other managers besides. <br><br>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout you?&#x201d; Dean asked me. <br><br>I nodded, quickly. I suddenly wanted, very badly, to impress this man. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just now finishing my eighth week at the Glass Hat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;In the Belmont Plaza.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Really? I live there,&#x201d; Dean said. <br><br>&#x201c;At the Glass Hat?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, at the Belmont. It&#x2019;s part of my radio deal.&#x201d; <br><br>Just at that moment, a beautiful brunette walked by, in a coat with a fur-trimmed collar. Dean lowered his eyelids slightly and flashed her that grin&#x2013;and damned if she didn&#x2019;t smile right back! How come I never got that reaction? She gave him a lingering gaze over her shoulder as she passed, a clear invitation, and Dean shook his head, smiling his regrets. <br><br>&#x201c;Look at this guy,&#x201d; Sonny said in his hoarse Brooklyn accent. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got pussy radar!&#x201d; <br><br>One look at Sonny&#x2019;s eyes was enough to tell me that he idolized Dean&#x2013;whose attention, all at once, I felt anxious to get back. &#x201c;You ever go to Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s?&#x201d; I asked, my voice sounding even higher and squeakier than its usual high and squeaky. Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s was a restaurant and nightclub a couple of blocks away, on fabulous Fifty-second Street&#x2013;which, in those days, was lined with restaurants and former speakeasies, like &#x201c;21,&#x201d; and music clubs like the Five Spot and Birdland. Live entertainment still ruled America in those pretelevi�sion days, Manhattan was the world capital of nightclubs, and Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s was a mecca for nightclub comics. Sunday night was Celebrity Night: The fun would start after hours, when anybody in the business might show up and get on to do a piece of their act. You&#x2019;d see the likes of Milton Berle, Henny Youngman, Danny Kaye. It was magical. I used to go and gawk, like a kid in a candy store. <i>Someday</i>, I thought. . . . But for now, no chance. They&#x2019;d never use a dumb act&#x2013;one needing props, yet. <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sometimes I stop by Sunday nights,&#x201d; Dean said. <br><br>&#x201c;Me too!&#x201d; I cried. <br><br>He gave me that smile again&#x2013;warm but ever so slightly cool around the edges. It bathed you in its glow, yet didn&#x2019;t let you in. Men don&#x2019;t like to admit it, but there&#x2019;s something about a truly handsome guy who also happens to be truly masculine&#x2013;what they call a <i>man&#x2019;s man</i>&#x2013;that&#x2019;s as magnetic to us as it is to women. <i>That&#x2019;s what I want to be like</i>, you think. <i>Maybe if I hang around with him, some of that&#x2019;ll rub off on me</i>. <br><br>&#x201c;So&#x2013;maybe I&#x2019;ll see you there sometime,&#x201d; Dean told me. <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;Go get your tux out of hock,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>I laughed. He was funny. <br><br>***<br><br>Sonny King was a pal, but not a friend. I badly needed a friend. I was a lonely kid, the only child of two vaudevillians who were rarely around. My dad, Danny, was a singer and all-around entertainer: He did it all&#x2013; patter, impressions, stand-up comedy. My mom, Rachel (Rae), was Danny&#x2019;s pianist and conductor. So I grew up shuttled from household to household, relative to relative. I cherished the precious times Mom and Dad would take me on the road with them. And for them, the highest form of togetherness was to put me right in the act: My first onstage appearance was at age five, in 1931, at the President Hotel, a summer resort in Swan Lake, New York. I wore a tux (naturally) and sang that Depression classic &#x201c;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&#x201d; From that moment on, showbiz was in my blood. So was loneliness. <br><br>By the time I was sixteen, I was a high-school dropout and a show-business wannabe. A <i>desperately</i>-wanting-to-be wannabe. I worked the Catskill resorts as a busboy (for pay) and (for free) a tummler&#x2013;the guy who cuts up, makes faces, gets the guests in a good mood for the real entertainment. That&#x2019;s what I wanted to be, the real entertainment. But what was I going to do? I was tall, skinny, gawky; cute but funny-looking. With the voice God had given me, I certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to be a singer like my dad, with his Al Jolson baritone. I always saw the humor in things, the joke possibilities. At the same time, I didn&#x2019;t have the con�fidence to stand on a stage and talk. <br><br>Then I hit on a genius solution&#x2013;or what seemed at the time like a genius solution. One night, at a New Jersey resort where my parents were doing their act, a friend of mine, an aspiring performer, Lonnie Brown&#x2013;the daughter of Charlie and Lillian Brown, resort hotelkeepers who were destined to become very important in my life&#x2013;was listening to a record by an English singer named Cyril Smith, trying to learn those classy English intonations. I had a little crush on Lonnie, and, attempt�ing to impress her, I started to clown around, mouthing along to the music, rolling my eyes and playing the diva. Well, Lonnie broke up, and <i>that</i> was music to my ears. An act was born. <br><br>After a couple of hard years on the road, playing burlesque houses where the guys with newspapers on their laps would boo me off the stage so they could see the strippers, I became a showbiz veteran (still in my teens) with an act called &#x201c;Jerry Lewis&#x2013;Satirical Impressions in Pan�tomimicry.&#x201d; <br><br>I had perfected the act, and to tell the absolute truth, it was pretty goddamn funny. I would put on a fright wig and a frock coat and lip-synch to the great baritone Igor Gorin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Largo Al Factotum&#x201d; from <i>The Barber of Seville</i>. I&#x2019;d come out in a Carmen Miranda dress, with fruit on my hat, and do Miranda. Then into a pin-striped jacket, suck in my cheeks, and I&#x2019;d do Sinatra singing &#x201c;All or Nothing at All.&#x201d; I knew where every scratch and skip was on every record, and when they came up, I&#x2019;d do shtick to them. I had gotten better and better at contorting my long, skinny body in ways that I knew worked comedically. I practiced making faces in front of a mirror till I cracked myself up.

He writes a wine column for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and is a regular contributor to <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Corriere della Sera</i>, and his fiction has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Esquire, Playboy, Granta, </i>and<i> The Paris Review</i>. In 2006, <i>Time</i> cited <i>Bright Lights, Big City</i> as one of nine generation-defining novels of the twentieth century, and <i>The Good Life</i> received the Prix Litt�raire at the Deauville Film Festival in 2007. <i>How It Ended: New and Collected Stories</i> (2009) &#x201c;reminds us,&#x201d; Sam Tanenhaus wrote in <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> &#x201c;how impressively broad McInerney&#x2019;s scope has been and how confidently he has ranged across wide swaths of our national experience."</p>Introduction<br><br>It all began with Hemingway, as so many things do. Specifically with <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, or, as the Brits call it, <i>Fiesta</i>. The latter title being apposite, because part of what I carried away from that book in my youth was the sense that drinking wine was cool and sophisticated. And let&#x2019;s face it, this is one of the reasons we read books, especially in our youth, particularly books by Hemingway and Kerouac and Lawrence Durrell: to find out how to live and how to pose and where to travel and what to eat and drink and smoke along the way. Everybody in Hemingway&#x2019;s first novel is drinking wine. Not long after my vicarious adventures in Pam- plona, this sense of wine as an appurtenance of the well-lived life was reinforced by Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, with Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte picturesquely draining the cel- lar at that estate over the course of a summer. I was so fixated on the wine and the scenery that I don&#x2019;t think I bothered to grasp the nature of their friendship. Not very Hemingwayesque, but again, for some reason I remember the wine . . .<br><br>The fact that wine had no place on my parents&#x2019; suburban dining table seemed to confirm its consumption as a mark of sophistication. They and their friends drank cocktails&#x2014;martinis, Manhattans, old-fashioneds, and stingers. And when they drank enough of them, they behaved badly, especially when they were in their stingers period, though this didn&#x2019;t strike me as romantic or chic. Much later I realized they were acting like the people in John Cheever&#x2019;s stories, once I finally got around to reading them; in fact it took me years to appreciate his writing, in part because his characters resembled my parents and their friends.<br><br>Hemingway was a great fan of Spanish<i> rosado</i>, which might be why, on my very first date, at the age of sixteen, I ordered a bottle of Mateus rose&#x301;, the spritzy Portuguese pink that came in a Buddha-shaped bottle. Never have I felt quite so worldly as I did that night at the Log Cabin Restaurant in Lenox, Massachusetts, as I sniffed the cork and nodded to the waiter. Many of my college romances were initiated over a bottle of Cha&#x302;teauneuf-du-Pape, the only red wine whose name I could remember, but while lurching toward adulthood, I preferred quicker fixes, partly in the semicon- scious belief, suggested by so much of my reading, that the road of excess would lead to the palace of wisdom, that the pursuit of an artistic career as a writer required a strictly Dionysian regi- men. Manhattan in the early eighties was a congenial venue for this aesthetic program, especially if your role models included Baudelaire, Dylan Thomas, Keith Richards, and Tom Verlaine. I worked at menial editorial jobs and, briefly, as a fact-checker for <i>The New Yorker</i> as I did my best to infiltrate the downtown night- club scene, which I imagined to be the contemporary equivalent of Isherwood&#x2019;s Berlin or Lautrec&#x2019;s Montmartre.<br><br>Not long after I was fired by <i>The New Yorker</i>, I was awakened at the crack of 2:00 p.m. by a call from my best friend, who informed me that Raymond Carver was en route to my apartment. You could have knocked me over with a rolled-up twenty-dollar bill, several of which were lying on my bedside table. <i>Jesus Christ!</i> Raymond Carver on my doorstep? Granted, there was some context here: my best friend, Gary Fisketjon, a junior editor at Random House, had reviewed a chapbook by Carver fo<i>r The Village Voice</i> and, through his legendary champion Gordon Lish, had gotten to know him. (He would later become Carver&#x2019;s editor, as well as my own.) Some years before, when we were at Williams College, I lent Gary a book called <i>Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?</i>, and since then we&#x2019;d both been passionate Carver fans. Now Gary was returning the favor with interest. They&#x2019;d had lunch together, and Carver had nothing to do until his reading at Columbia that evening, so Gary volunteered my services as a tour guide for the afternoon, assuming that I would be thrilled. Which I was, despite an apocalyptic headache. The buzzer rang, an indistinct mumble came through the intercom&#x2014;and then the doorway was filled by this hulking, slouching bear whom I ushered in to a tiny Greenwich Village apartment that showed all the signs of an arduous, recently terminated binge. We never got around to touring the city and instead talked for four or five hours, mostly about writing, until it was well past time to get Carver to his reading. At some point he said, almost apologetically, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, the life you&#x2019;re living here doesn&#x2019;t seem exactly conducive to writing.&#x201d; While it didn&#x2019;t take a master storyteller to make this observation, from him it sounded like an epiphany. Carver knew whereof he spoke, a devotee of Alcoholics Anonymous who credited that organization with saving his life. Six months later I moved to Syracuse to study with Ray and clean up my act.<br><br>Having heard nutritionists distinguish between good fats and bad fats, I would propose a similar dichotomy for intoxicants. Certainly this was the opinion of Thomas Jefferson, the nation&#x2019;s first wine geek. &#x201c;No nation is drunken where wine is cheap,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage. It is, in truth, the only antidote to the bane of whiskey.&#x201d; Or vodka, I might add. One can&#x2019;t help but wonder how different Russia&#x2019;s history might have been if the country was warm enough for viticulture. &#x201c;Wine is one of the most civilized things in the world,&#x201d; Hemingway wrote in <i>Death in the Afternoon</i>, &#x201c;and one of the natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection, and it offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than, possibly, any other purely sensory thing.&#x201d; Not his greatest prose, perhaps, and like so many encomiums to wine&#x2014;the earnest Jefferson&#x2019;s springs to mind&#x2014;it leaves out the buzz factor. (They don&#x2019;t, for example, call them winos for nothing.)Still, it impressed me at the time, especially since I&#x2019;d discovered that the bane of whiskey and the road of excess hadn&#x2019;t led me to any palaces at all.<br><br>But Syracuse was leading me in far more rewarding directions, in large part thanks to Ray and Tobias Wolff demonstrating how to advance from apprenticeship into actual <i>writing</i>. To supplement my fellowship&#x2014;tuition plus four grand a year&#x2014;I worked as a clerk in the Westcott Cordial Shop, whose Princeton-educated proprietor had an extensive wine library and high hopes for the scabrous neighborhood&#x2019;s eventual gentrification. Here I could oscillate between the stories of Isaac Babel and Hugh Johnson&#x2019;s <i>World Atlas of Wine</i>, dip into the stock after finishing my shift, and gradually refine my rudimentary palate.<br><br>This is also where I got the call, some two years on, that my novel had been bought by Random House, and a subsequent one from a guy who kept calling me &#x201c;babe&#x201d; and wanted to fly me out to Hollywood to meet with his fellow executives at Paramount. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll put you up at the Chateau Marmont,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is that good?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better than good,&#x201d; he assured me. &#x201c;John Belushi died there.&#x201d; Clearly he&#x2019;d read Bright Lights, Big City, or at least the cov- erage of the book, and formed an opinion of my bad habits.<br><br>A decade later, I was able to merge these double-barreled habits of wine and writing. My friend Dominique Browning, in charge of resurrecting Conde&#x301; Nast&#x2019;s <i>House &amp; Garden</i>, knew of my devel- oping vinous passion, invited me to do a monthly column, and proceeded to send me pretty much any place in the world where I thought there was a good wine story&#x2014;a master-class education I am profoundly grateful for, and one that would be hard to imagine in this era of editorial budget slashing and what&#x2019;s beginning to look like the mass extinction of general-interest publications. Indeed, somewhat ahead of the curve, <i>House &amp; Garden</i> was shut down in 2007. Sad as I was about its demise and my friend&#x2019;s misfortune, I reasoned that it had been a hell of a good run. I&#x2019;d never intended to write about wine for more than a year or two, and it was time to turn all my energies back to fiction. And so I did until, a couple of years later, <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>came calling. A few of the following essays, much revised here, date back to Dominique&#x2019;s magazine, and most from my current gig. One of them, a review of Robert Mondavi&#x2019;s autobiography published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, seemed very much worth reprinting here in the wake of his passing. The world of wine would likely look&#x2014;and taste&#x2014;very different if not for Mondavi, whom I was fortunate enough to spend time with on several occasions.<br>Heraclitus tells us you can never step into the same river twice, &#x201c;for other waters are ever flowing on to you.&#x201d; And likewise, it seems to me, you can never really drink the same wine twice. The appreciation of wine, for all that we might try to quantify it, is in the end a subjective experience. More than a poem or a painting or a concerto, which is problematic enough for the aesthetician, the 1982 La Mission, say, or the 1999 Beaucastel is a moving target. Good wine continues to grow and develop in the glass and in the bottle, to change from one day to the next in response to baro- metric pressures and other variables; moreover, any given wine&#x2014; from the same maker, the same vintage, even the same barrel&#x2014;is subject to our own quirks of receptivity, to the place and the com- pany in which we drink it, to the knowledge we bring with us, and to the food with which we pair it. Even so, in order to develop our appreciation, we agree to a fictional objectivity and attempt to iso- late wine from these contextual variables, to treat each and every glass in front of us as if it contained a stable and quantifiable sub- stance. We Americans are often scolded for adhering to this view, and one critic in particular has been accused of reducing wine&#x2019;s infinite variety and complexity to a vulgar game of numbers. On the other hand, the felon in question, Robert Parker, has helped to democratize and demystify something that until very recently was stuffy, arcane, and elitist. His core belief&#x2014;that wine can be evaluated and graded like any other consumer product&#x2014;was hugely liberating for those of us on both sides of the Atlantic who wanted to penetrate the mysteries of the great French growths. And it took this middle-class lawyer, who&#x2019;d grown up drinking <i>soft drinks </i>with meals, to begin to clear away the musty, upper-class stench of oenophilia.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve learned quite a bit in the last fifteen years, and my tastes have shifted accordingly (if sometimes mystifyingly). Burgundy has become something of an obsession, and there are more than a few essays&#x2014;an entire section, actually&#x2014;devoted to the fickle, intermittently exhilarating, and heartbreaking wines of that region. But I still love Bordeaux, not only the famous wines, but also the Crus Bourgeois from relatively obscure corners like Fronsac and Lalande-de-Pomerol, which represent tremendous value in the face of the madly escalating prices of the classed growths from the 2009 and 2010 vintages. Just when I think my interest in California is flagging, I taste a new wine like Steve Matthiasson&#x2019;s white blend or an old one like Araujo&#x2019;s 1995 Eisele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and get excited all over again. Italy now accounts for about a third of American wine imports and for me remains a continuing source of wonder and pleasure. Spain might well be the new Italy, a country with a long history of wine making that&#x2019;s finally waking up to its potential. Something similar is happening in South Africa, which has a wine-making tradition extending back to the seventeenth century. Some of the wines I write about here are costly and hard to find, but I believe it&#x2019;s one of the wine writer&#x2019;s duties, however arduous it might sound, to bring back news of the best and the rarest, just as it&#x2019;s the travel writer&#x2019;s duty to explore exotic and remote destina- tions. Most readers of automotive magazines won&#x2019;t ever drive a Lamborghini or a Ferrari, and most wine drinkers will never hold a glass of Cha&#x302;teau Latour, but as an avid reader of <i>Car and Driver</i> I&#x2019;d hate to see it limit its coverage to sensible, affordable rides. No, I want a knowledgeable, badass driver to tell me what it&#x2019;s like to power the new Gallardo Superleggera through the Alps. So, yes, there&#x2019;s some wine porn here. That said, some of the most surpris- ing and exciting moments involve obscure and undervalued wines like the 2007 Movia Pinot Grigio from Slovenia or overachievers like the 2007 Cha&#x302;teau Jean Faux Bordeaux, which at $25 retail is $1,200 cheaper than the 2010 Latour.<br><br>Much as I have ostensibly learned since I started writing about wine, and as lucky as I have been to have tasted some of the renowned vintages, I&#x2019;m not sure that I&#x2019;ve ever enjoyed a bot- tle of wine more than I did that Mateus rose&#x301; back in the Berk- shires in 1972. I&#x2019;d lately acquired my driver&#x2019;s license and was in the company of my first love, with the night and the entire sum- mer stretched out ahead of me like a river full of fat, silvery, pink- fleshed rainbow trout. The wine tasted like summer, and it was about to become the taste of my first real kiss.</p><h2>The Evolution Angel: An Emergency Physician&#39;s Lessons with Death and the Divine</h2><p><b>I asked him, &#x201c;Are you the angel of death?

But one natural psychedelic in particular towers above the rest in its astonishing power to replace the normal waking world with a bizarre alternate reality replete with a diverse panoply of intelligent alien beings. As well as being the most powerful, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, more commonly known as DMT, is also the most common naturally-occurring psychedelic and can be found in countless plant species scattered across the Earth. DMT carries a profound message embedded in our reality, a message that we are now beginning to decode.</p><p>In Alien Information Theory, neurobiologist, chemist, and pharmacologist, Dr. Andrew R. Gallimore, explains how DMT provides the secret to the very structure of our reality, and how our Universe can be likened to a cosmic game that we now find ourselves playing.&nbsp;</p><p>Gallimore explains how our reality was constructed using a fundamental code which generated our Universe &#x2014; and countless others &#x2014; as a digital device built from pure information with the purpose of enabling conscious intelligences, such as ourselves, to emerge. You will learn how fundamental digital information self-organises and complexifies to generate the myriad complex forms and organisms that fill our world; how your brain constructs your subjective world and how psychedelic drugs alter the structure of this world; how DMT switches the reality channel by allowing the brain to access information from normally hidden orthogonal dimensions of reality. And, finally, you will learn how DMT provides the secret to exiting our Universe permanently &#x2014; to complete the cosmic game and to become interdimensional citizens of hyperspace.</p><p>Alien Information Theory is a unique account of this hidden structure of reality and our place within it, drawing on a diverse range of disciplines -- including neuroscience, computer science, physics, and pharmacology -- to carefully explain these&nbsp;complex ideas, which are illustrated with full-colour diagrams throughout.</p></p><p></p><h2>Spawn: Origins Volume 11</h2><p><ul> <li>Spawn partners with Terry Fitzgerald as his plans to take down Jason Wynn continue.

Galeano also highlights individuals such as Pedro Fernandes Sardinha, the first bishop of Brazil, who was eaten by Caete Indians off the coast of Alagoas, as well as Abdul Kassem Ismael, the grand vizier of Persia, who kept books safe from war by creating a walking library of 117,000 tomes aboard four hundred camels, forming a mile-long caravan.<br>Beautifully translated by Galeano's longtime collaborator, Mark Fried, <i>Children of the Days</i> is a majestic humanist treasure that shows us how to live and how to remember. It awakens the best in us.</p><p><b>Eduardo Galeano</b> (1940-2015) was one of Latin America's most distinguished writers. A Uruguayan journalist, writer and novelist, he was considered, among other things, "a literary giant of the Latin American left" and "global soccer's pre-eminent man of letters." He is the author of the three-volume <i>Memory of Fire; Open Veins of Latin America;</i> <i>Soccer in Sun and Shadow</i>; <i>The Book of Embraces</i>; <i>Walking Words</i>; <i>Upside Down</i>; and <i>Voices in Time</i>. Born in Montevideo in 1940, he lived in exile in Argentina and Spain for years before returning to Uruguay. His work has been translated into twenty-eight languages. He is recipient of many international prizes, including the first Lannan Prize for Cultural Freedom, the Casa de las Americas Prize, and the First Distinguished Citizen of the region by the countries of Mercosur. Galeano once described himself as "a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia." Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i> "a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.""Bedtime stories, you remember?

He keeps giving it to us in abundance."<br><b>Buffalo News</b><br><br>"It's May, but this is a Christmas kind of a book: giftable, covetable, hefty, handsome, a veritable plum pudding of a thing, its lovely midnight-blue cover designed to look as though dotted with stars, or perhaps dusted with sugar, and slathered all over with generous custardy recommendations from both Philip Pullman and John Berger... Galeano chronicles events and anniversaries from the history of oppressed nations, adding the odd dash of fictional fun and philosophical musing... The effect is dizzying, like staring up close for a very long time at the walls of Gaud�'s Sagrada Fam�lia...<i>Children of the Days</i> is the ne plus ultra of the Galeano style and form, a triumph of his mosaic art - 365 sad and strange and shiny little fragments, placed adjacent to one another to form a vast and seemingly coherent whole...This is a book of days, not for every day but for any day."<br><b>The Guardian</b><br><br>"Compelling, enlightening, tragic, hopeful, and hypnotic book: history in poetic snapshots... There are great stories in the book, pain and injustice too. And there is hope."<br><b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>"Eduardo Galeano is the great master of fragments and splinters, a prince of the absurdly truthful. <i>Children of the Days</i>, his Calendar of Human History, is an immensely varied gathering of facts and oddments and truths and stories of every kind. Underlying them all is a passionate and humane concern for the underdog, the poor, the forgotten. How this can be so funny and at the same time so moving is a great mystery."<br><b>Philip Pullman</b><br><br>"What category to put our beloved poet-historian, historian-poet in? Galeano is truly a Scheherazade. He keeps me morally awake, while also lifting my spirits with his ability to reveal in story-form the deep, sweet humanity which rebounds even after the cruelest moments of history. Reading Galeano, I'm often reminded of Joseph Conrad's claims for what writing should do: 'art itself may be defined as a single-minded attempt to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by bringing to light the truth, manifold and one, underlying its every aspect.' That is reason enough to stay morally awake!"<br><b>Julia Alvarez</b></p><h2>SACRED EARTH ORACLE CARDS (45 cards &amp; guidebook, boxed)</h2><p>Life on Earth is the ultimate success story!

This original and essential guide is a passport to the wondrous, and tragic, dimensions of the human psyche. Contains a new foreword by the author.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A master course by a master teacher.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marilyn Ferguson, author of <i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i></p><p><b>Jean Houston, Ph.D.</b>, is the bestselling author of many books, including <b>The Possible Human, The Search for the Beloved</b>, and <b>A Passion for the Possible</b>.

Suddenly, you are right there, an intense observer and participant in all the inner wit and wisdom, in knowings, growings, havings, being more present and alive in several moments than you had been in the previous drowse of years. Many of the so-called larger-than-life people differ from the rest of us chiefly in this one respect: not that they are actually larger or greater or more brilliant, but rather that they are profoundly present to the continuum of their lives. Of course there is more to them. The ages one to ten are present and accounted for, as are ages twenty to thirty, thirty to forty, and so on. There occurs an exponential gain and growth in the creative living use of all one's experience. Thus some die at seventy with an experiential age of seventeen while others are closer to a hundred and seventy, so intimate are they with the happenings of their lives. <p> At the height of laughter the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. High comedy, and the laughter that ensues, is an evolutionary event. Together they evoke a biological response that drives the organism to higher levels of organization and integration. Laughter is the loaded latency given us by nature as part of our native equipment to break up the stalemates of our lives and urge us on to deeper and more complex forms of knowing.</p></p><h2>Expect the Unexpected: Bringing Peace, Healing, and Hope from the Other Side</h2><p><b>Part memoir, part spiritual exploration, part inspiring stories, <i>Expect the Unexpected</i> provides knowledge and support for tapping into spiritual realms we do not fully understand.</b><br><br>Bill Philipps had the kind of childhood that seems too tragic to be true drug-addicted parents, parental kidnapping, homelessness. At fourteen, he watched his mother die. Two days later she appeared to him, letting him know she was spiritually alive. From then on, spirits knocked on his door.&#x201d; He tried to ignore them. He wanted to be normal.&#x201d; But as he pursued his singing gift at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, his psychic gift pressed for a hearing. As Philipps gave readings as a psychic medium, witnessing the comfort the spirits offered, he came to accept and honor his abilities.<br><br>With testimonies from many people, <i>Expect the Unexpected</i> is an honest firsthand account of how spirits communicate with Philipps, why he believes they chose him to do this, and how he works with them to ultimately convey their messages. He offers insight and suggestions to help ask for and receive signs with or without a medium and shows why he is convinced that readings always contain the possibility for love, peace, healing, and hope.</p><p><b>Bill Philipps </b>is a psychic medium who helps the deceased communicate with their loved ones on earth.

It is summed up in the statement, &#x201c;War is Peace; Freedom is slavery; Ignorance is strength.&#x201d; The story of this book, Manifest Destiny, is an account of how agencies of US intelligence including the CIA and State Department, in collaboration with private &#x201c;democracy&#x201d; NGOs, developed and refined techniques of Orwellian doublethink or cognitive dissonance to create a series of regime changes around the world that sounded noble, democratic, but in reality were not. William Engdahl describes the background beginning in the 1980&#x2019;s with Reagan&#x2019;s CIA Director leading to creation of a series of private NGO&#x2019;s to covertly manipulate aspirations for freedom and democracy from Poland and other communist countries in the late 1980&#x2019;s, to the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia and China. The book details the refinement of what came to be called Color Revolutions by the early years of this century in Ukraine, Georgia and later with the US-orchestrated Arab Spring. It&#x2019;s an account of how elite circles in the USA and Europe along with their think tanks refined methods to impose a new tyranny on countries from Ukraine to Egypt to Libya and beyond. The aim was to use democratic aspirations of ordinary people, often youth, to topple regimes resisting what David Rockefeller once called a One World Government, a global corporate tyranny. This is an almost incredible chronicle of how select NGOS speak about freedom, human rights, democracy in order to bring war, violence and terror. The book is a must read for anyone wanting to truly understand world events of the past three decades or more.</p><p>F.

And having more than one person to help decide is good because the group benefits from the collective knowledge of all of its members, and this results in better decisions. Right?</p><p>Back to reality. We&#x2019;ve all been involved in group decisions&#x2015;and they&#x2019;re hard. And they often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on &#x201c;groupthink&#x201d; without a clear idea of what that term really means.</p><p>Now, <i>Nudge</i> coauthor Cass Sunstein and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed light on the specifics of why and how group decisions go wrong&#x2015;and offer tactics and lessons to help leaders avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. In the first part of the book, they explain in clear and fascinating detail the distinct problems groups run into:</p><ul><li>They often <i>amplify</i>, rather than correct, individual errors in judgment</li><li>They fall victim to <i>cascade effects</i>, as members follow what others say or do</li><li>They become <i>polarized</i>, adopting more extreme positions than the ones they began with</li><li>They emphasize <i>what everybody knows</i> instead of focusing on critical information that only a few people know</li></ul><p></p><p>In the second part of the book, the authors turn to straightforward methods and advice for making groups smarter. These approaches include silencing the leader so that the views of other group members can surface, rethinking rewards and incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge, thoughtfully assigning roles that are aligned with people&#x2019;s unique strengths, and more.</p><p>With examples from a broad range of organizations&#x2015;from Google to the CIA&#x2015;and written in an engaging and witty style, <i>Wiser</i> will not only enlighten you; it will help your team and your organization make better decisions&#x2015;decisions that lead to greater success.</p></p><p><p><b>Cass R.

In "Note to Sixth-Grade Self" a band of popular girls exert their social power over an awkward outcast. In "Isabel Fish" fourteen-year-old Maddy learns to scuba dive in order to mend her family after a terrible accident. Alive with the victories, humiliations, and tragedies of youth, <b>How to Breathe Underwater</b><i> </i>illuminates this powerful territory with striking grace and intelligence.<br><br>"These stories are without exception clear-eyed, compaassionate and deeply moving.... Even her most bitter characters have a gift, the sharp wit of envy. This, Orringer's first book, is breathtakingly good, truly felt and beautifully delivered."&#x2014;The Guardian&nbsp;</p></p><p>The stories in <i>How to Breathe Underwater</i>, Julie Orringer's debut collection, swim with tragedies both commonplace and horrific. A fall from a treehouse, an ailing mother, a near-drowning, a premature baby, a gun--each is the source of a young woman's coming-of-age, which we witness through Orringer's lovely, driving prose. The author possesses an uncanny ability to capture scenes and complex emotions in quick strokes. In "Pilgrims," young Ella is taken to a hippie household for Thanksgiving, where her mother joins several other cancer patients in search of natural remedies: "Some of them wore knitted hats like her mother, their skin dull-gray, their eyes purple-shaded underneath. To Ella it seemed they could be relatives of her mother's, shameful cousins recently discovered." Shame is as omnipresent as water in this collection, sadly appropriate for stories about girls becoming women. Orringer possesses an acute understanding of the many rules of girlhood, in particular the uniquely childish importance of "not telling" (for fear of becoming a traitor, and consequently, an outcast). But though her subjects may take us to the murky depths--submerging us in the cruelties girls and siblings commit against each other--Orringer's nimble writing and subtle humor allow us to breathe. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>&#x201c;Intelligent, heartfelt stories that tell a whole new set of truths about growing up American. Julie&nbsp;Orringer writes with virtuosity and depth about the fears, cruelties, and humiliations of childhood, but then does that rarest, and more difficult, thing: writes equally beautifully about the moments of victory and transcendence.&#x201d; &#x2013;George Saunders<br><br>&#x201c;Julie Orringer is the real thing, a breathtaking chronicler of the secrets and cruelties underneath the surface of middle-class American life.

These are tough, beautiful stories, piercing and true, and they mark the debut of an exceptionally gifted writer.&#x201d; &#x2013;Ann Packer<br><i><br></i></p><h2>The Peace Tree from Hiroshima: The Little Bonsai with a Big Story</h2><p><b>**Winner of the 2017 <i>Creative Child Magazine</i> Preferred Choice Award ** <br>**Winner of the 2015 Gelett Burgess Award for Best Intercultural Book** <br>**Winner of the 2015 Silver Evergreen Medal for World Peace**</b> <br><br>This true children's story is told by a little bonsai tree, called Miyajima, that lived with the same family in the Japanese city of Hiroshima for more than 300 years before being donated to the National Arboretum in Washington DC in 1976 as a gesture of friendship between America and Japan to celebrate the American Bicentennial.<br><br><b>From the Book:</b><br><i>"In 1625, when Japan was a land of samurai and castles, I was a tiny pine seedling.

Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, an Oklahoma woman phoned her sister in North Carolina to share the terrible news. &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; her sister responded. &#x201c;Can you imagine the angels that were there!&#x201d;<br>It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of reaction one would expect in the midst of tragedy. Positive points of view, if there are any, usually emerge days or even months later, when dust has settled and ��people have moved beyond those first shocking moments. But the woman in North Carolina was seeing past the immediate horror into a spiri�tual realm, where even the most terrible happenings can be turned into good.<br>A few days later, the sisters heard about a woman who had been preparing food for a funeral luncheon at her church, west of Oklahoma City, when the explosion occurred. She packed everything into her car to bring to the disaster scene, some twenty miles away, and as she drove onto an overpass, she had a view of the city. The hair stood up on the back of her neck. A gigantic cloud hung over the skyline, filled with hundreds of angels. She could clearly see them, all facing west, trailing long graceful wings, angels standing silent vigil over the ruins, confirming the revelation of the woman from North Carolina.1<br>A week after the World Trade Center explosions, word circulated that a trumpeter was playing at Ground Zero. A well-known photographer went to see for himself. In the eerie quiet of lower Manhattan, he could hear the notes as he approached a barricade. &#x201c;The trumpeter stood in this urban canyon, illuminated by shafts of light caused by the smoke and dust.&#x201d; Who was he? In a place of such intense security, how could a lone musician be allowed behind police lines? Looking through his lens, framing the unlikely stranger amid the rays, the photographer realized that this was the photo of a lifetime. &#x201c;But I ��couldn&#x2019;t depress the shutter,&#x201d; he said. He lowered the camera in defeat.<br>His colleagues reported the same phenomenon. Apparently, no one could snap a picture. &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s an angel,&#x201d; one suggested.<br>Mark Judelson, executive director of the Arts Council of Rockland, New York, was struck by this event and has written and performed a miniplay about it. Today he says, &#x201c;I think the trumpeter was the angel Gabriel. With his music, he blessed this site of carnage and taught us to accept loss.&#x201d;<br>Who could have imagined, a few decades ago, speaking of angels in such matter-of-fact conversations, allowing these heavenly beings into our lives as mysterious intercessors, cherished companions, dependable protectors? Since the early 1990s&#x2014;when angels made somewhat of a popular comeback&#x2014;books, movies, stores, and even Time and Newsweek cover stories have focused on them not as myth but as a unique part of God&#x2019;s creation. Perhaps at this uncertain moment in history, they are needed more than ever. Peter Kreeft, an angelologist, author, and professor at Boston College has observed that angels &#x201c;appear on the brink of chaos, or catastrophe, or at least the threat of chaos or catastrophe. They are spiri�tual soldiers in the great cosmic jihad, the spiri�tual war between good and evil.&#x201d; Upon reflection, he says, it seems not such a strange idea. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t there often seem to be an unknown, unpredictable, invisible factor in history, especially in times of physical or spiri�tual conflict, culture wars or spiri�tual warfare?&#x201d; Perhaps the emergence of angels in the public consciousness during the 1990s was intended to be that &#x201c;invisible factor,&#x201d; a merciful heavenly preparation for the difficult events that were to come.<br>Terrorist attacks on American soil and subsequent war have ended our peaceful complacency, perhaps forever. Church �scandals have betrayed not only children but also the faithful in the pews. Corporate greed and personal corruption have seriously affected employees, stockholders, and retirees. The lack of moral principles in government; the misuse of the Internet; impoverished children in the midst of a society sated with &#x201c;stuff&#x201d;; a drug culture connected to more than 60 percent of the crimes in America; an entertainment industry pushing the limits of decency. Consider too the unnerving increase in natural disasters&#x2014;the floods, tornadoes, and wildfires that can ruin lifetimes of labor in an instant&#x2014;or the appearance of new and deadly diseases. We who were taught to maintain control over every aspect of our lives have discovered that such control is elusive, sometimes even im�pos�sible. In the past few years, nearly every institution in which we have placed our trust has faltered or collapsed, and the sense of loss can be overwhelming. Some have described it as a huge national mourning, with undercurrents of fear and grief even at the happiest of times. Many are poised for additional threats, wondering if God has ��simply abandoned us.<br>Yet this may be precisely the time when �people can truly grow and change. Tragedy is a harsh refining process, but it creates new substance by tearing away the smug materialism and mis-directed goals that may have driven us in an earlier time. People who rise from the ashes of despair will inevitably make the world a better place, but it is not an easy process. Elisabeth K�bler-Ross, the psychiatrist and author of the groundbreaking On Death and Dying, was perhaps the first to identify actual stages that �people must experience and work through in order to ��handle bereavement in a healthy way. These stages, whether personal or global, include shock and denial, acknowledgement and intense sorrow, a period of disorganization and confusion, and finally, accep-tance, moving on, and hopefully creating something positive out of the loss. Kenneth L. Pierpont, a pastor and director of the Character Inn Christian ministry in Flint, Michigan, says, &#x201c;That is the way God usually works. He usually takes us through the valley of the shadow of death before we arrive at the table he has prepared for us. Some dark and difficult days are usually a part of God&#x2019;s good plan. That was true for the Lord Jesus himself. That will always be true for each of us.&#x201d;<br>Gospel musician Thomas Andrew Dorsey wrote the hymn &#x201c;Precious Lord&#x201d; while grieving the death of a loved one. &#x201c;I am tired, I am weak, I am worn,&#x201d; the song laments. As Dorsey faced his sorrow, though, he said, &#x201c;the Lord healed my spirit. I learned that when we are in our deepest anguish, when we feel farthest from God, this is when he is closest, and when we are most open to his restoring power.&#x201d; It can be the same for us.<br>As we travel this challenging journey, we are not alone. As we have learned, angels go alongside us. These marvelous beings, �created at the beginning of time, are greater in power and might than any human&#x2014;just two angels were sent to destroy all of Sodom and Gomorrah. Nonetheless, angels are concerned with every facet of our well-being; an angel even brought food to the prophet Elijah, advising Elijah that he would be of no use to the Lord if he was exhausted. Angels convey messages, warn us, and probably &#x201c;run interference&#x201d; with our consciences, prompting us to choose good over evil and strengthening us in times of temptation. Moreover, because they act only on God&#x2019;s authority and within his plan for us, God has promised us their aid: &#x201c;See, I am sending an angel before you, to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared. Be attentive to him, and heed his voice. Do not rebel against him for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my authority resides in him&#x201d; (Exodus 23:20&#x2013;21 NAB). What a great gift. How foolish we would be to disregard it.<br>Of course, an angel&#x2019;s role is not always to lift our burden&#x2014;recall that during Christ&#x2019;s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, an angel was sent to strengthen him, not to take the anguish away. Sometimes angels ��simply walk with us through our distress, bringing their glory and grace to bear on whatever hardships we face, helping us lift our eyes from the event at hand to the will of God behind the event. Perhaps what we need most in the present uncertain climate is the comfort of angels.<br>Stories about comfort abound. One hospital patient explains, &#x201c;I felt a warmth come over me, as if angels were all around. In the midst of my fear, I was flooded with reassurance. Whatever tomorrow&#x2019;s surgery revealed, I would �handle it.&#x201d;<br>Describing a chance encounter with an unusual street person, a teenager recounts, &#x201c;His eyes were full of love. All my worry dis-appeared. I thought, If God loves me, then why should I be upset about stuff I can&#x2019;t control, like bombs?&#x201d;<br>Such episodes of care, reassurance, blessing, and love are balm to our shaken spirits as we come to understand that God&#x2019;s promise is the only one worth counting on; his path is the true way to peace. Look back at the &#x201c;coincidences&#x201d; in your life with new eyes. Hasn&#x2019;t God been with you every step of your journey, even though you might not have recognized him? Hasn&#x2019;t he sent help and consolation in trying times, healed your broken heart, brought certain �people into your life at the perfect moment? (Could some of those �people have been angels in disguise?) Why should it be any different today than it was in biblical times?<br>The future holds excitement and opportunity. We may grow inwardly in new ways, emerge stronger, holier, and more interested in ministering to the needs of ��others than to ourselves. We may learn that the �people in our lives are far more important than any personal achievement or possession. The Rabbi Harold Kushner once observed that all the complicated structures we spend so much time and energy creating are built on sand. &#x201c;Only our relationships to other �people endure. Sooner or later, the wave will come along and knock down what we have worked so hard to build up. When that happens, only the person who has someone&#x2019;s hand to hold will be able to laugh.&#x201d;<br>As the �people whose stories are in this book have learned, we need not fear the future, for we have God&#x2019;s hand to hold. He has given us everything we need. Peace, hope, and comfort abide in his arms&#x2014;and in the arms of angels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gage&#x2019;s Girls<br>And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, <br>and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold <br>the angels of God ascending and descending on it.<br>&#x2014;Genesis 28:12 KJV&nbsp;December 24, 2001, started out like any other Christmas Eve for the townspeople of Moncton, New Brunswick. Last-minute shoppers mingled with church- and partygoers, and despite the rainy weather, a sense of anticipation filled the air. Twenty-four-year-old Tobi Gabriel and her three-year-old son, Gage, were part of the happy throng. Tobi, a resident of Toronto, had driven to her hometown of Moncton to spend the holidays with her son and her mother. Sometime around two o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon on this gloomy Christmas Eve, Tobi grew restless. She bundled Gage in a warm sweater and sweatpants, grabbed her coat, and headed for the door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going out to rent a movie, Mom. We&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; Her mother, elbow-deep in food preparation, barely noticed.<br>Tobi and Gage never returned. At about eleven o&#x2019;clock at night, Tobi&#x2019;s concerned mother phoned the police. It was almost Christmas, and brightly wrapped presents for her grandson were under the tree. Where could Tobi and Gage be?<br>It was a �little early for the police to suspect foul play. Tobi had many friends to visit and perhaps Gage had fallen asleep while in someone&#x2019;s home and the adults didn&#x2019;t want to wake him. Despite a now-freezing rain, there had been no accidents reported. Tobi should have phoned, but she&#x2019;d turn up. Such &#x201c;missing persons&#x201d; usually did.<br>Early the next morning, Linda Belliveau of the nearby town of Lower Cove went out to watch for her parents, whom she expected for Christmas-morning breakfast. It was dark and wet, and even more so along this shore area of the Bay of Fundy. &#x201c;I was glad I had left the lights on all night after I&#x2019;d returned from Midnight Mass,&#x201d; said Linda. The candles and manger scene were the only sources of illumination along the whole beach.<br>Despite the roar of the waves behind her, Linda thought she heard a cry, like that of a baby. Im�pos�sible. No children would be out on this frigid dawn. The cry sounded again, mournful and frightened. Linda says, &#x201c;Somehow, I felt compelled to find out what it was.&#x201d;<br>Linda hurried toward the sound. Ahead of her, alongside the shore, she saw a strange shape. As she neared it, Linda gasped. It was a car, lying upside down in the sand, just a short distance from the surf.<br>Linda realized that the car had probably plunged off the steep side of a nearby cliff, an area of highway known for being dangerous. There had been plenty of ice last night. She quickened her step. Surely no one could have survived. Yet she kept hearing that �little wail.<br>Suddenly, she made out a small figure on the sand, crawling toward her. It was a tiny child, scooting along on his elbows and weeping inconsolably. &#x201c;Honey!&#x201d; Linda ran to him. &#x201c;How did you get here? What happened?&#x201d; His clothes were soaked, and she tore off her own coat to wrap it around him.<br>The child clutched her. &#x201c;Mommy,&#x201d; he whispered.<br>In the growing dawn, Linda saw what must be a body, floating face down in the water. It was this child&#x2019;s mother. Was there any hope for her? Linda had been picking up the �little boy, but she paused. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and help your mommy,&#x201d; she told him. But the child tightened his grip on her. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go there.&#x201d;<br>She wondered what terrors he had been through during the night, what he had seen, how long he had been on this lonely, freezing beach. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, sweetheart?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Gage Gabriel. I lost my ducky boots.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll buy you another pair,&#x201d; Linda promised as she lifted him up once more. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring you back to my house and get you warm.&#x201d;<br>She saw her parents&#x2019; car pulling up. She decided that her dad could take charge of the scene because from the way Gage was clinging to her, she knew she&#x2019;d be going to the hospital with him. This was going to be a Christmas morning like no other.<br>Tobi Gabriel had died on impact. Preliminary investigations found that she had not been wearing her seat belt and that drugs or alcohol had not been involved. She had probably lost control of the car when she hit a patch of frozen sea spray. At least one passing driver had noticed skid marks on the road at about ten o&#x2019;clock at night, but police speculated that the accident had occurred several hours earlier because Tobi had been visiting friends and had left for home with Gage sometime after six.<br>Questions lingered about Gage. It appeared as if he had been lying down in the backseat, asleep. Since the car had rolled over at least twice&#x2014;and shattered glass had flown&#x2014;��shouldn&#x2019;t he have sustained more severe injuries than a bump on the head and bruised hips? How had he suffered only frostbitten toes during an estimated twelve hours of below-freezing temperatures, wearing just a wet sweater and knit pants? Had he slept or been unconscious for part of that time? Had he stayed in the car or crawled along the beach? Linda was glad she had left her lights on all night. &#x201c;Although he �couldn&#x2019;t tell us, I like to think that perhaps he saw Jesus and the shepherds and wasn&#x2019;t so afraid.&#x201d;<br>Perhaps even more miraculous, according to Sergeant Dale Bogle of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was that Gage didn&#x2019;t drown. &#x201c;Usua...</p><h2>Mankind in Amnesia</h2><p><p>Immanuel Velikovsky called this book the "fulfillment of his oath of Hippocrates - to serve humanity." In this book he returns to his roots as a psychologist and psychoanalytical therapist, yet not with a single person as his patient but with humanity as a whole. After an extremely revealing overview of the foundations of the various psychoanalytical systems he makes the step into crowd psychology and reopens the case of Worlds in Collision from a totally different point of view: as a psychoanalytical case study. This way he shows that the blatant reactions to his theories (which are still going on today) have not been surprising but are actually inevitable from a psychological perspective - which equally holds for those who have defined our view of the world. At the same time he is able to reclassify the theories of Siegmund Freud and of C. G. Jung by finding a common basis for them. A journey through history, religion, mythology and art shows the overall range of the collective trauma and gives us - the patients - a message of extraordinary urgency and importance for the future.</p></p><p></p><h2>Hidden Language Codes: Reprogram Your Life by Reengineering Your Vocabulary</h2><p><p>When R. Neville Johnston was shot three times in 1977, he died. But he came back knowing some things he hadn't known before. That the universe is made of up of vibrations for one. And that some of the most meaningful vibrations are the words we use in everyday thought and speech. Obviously it behooves us to choose our words with care so we can create the life we want.</p><p><i>Hidden Language Codes</i> is a book about thought. Where we go in life is directly related to our mastery and command of our thoughts and our language. In evolving, we naturally change the way we think. A method of accelerating this process is to change the very words we think with. This book is the key to learning words that will improve our lives and giving up the ones that hold us back. Learn to use power wordswords that serve us wellsuch as "acceptance," "faith," even "MacGyver," and the key power word, "love." Those words that do not serve us well include "greed," "blame," "hard," and the poster child for disempowerment/slave thinking "can't."</p><p>Our language is full of unconscious triggersthe words we speak are making decisions for us, running us. As long as we continue to try, need, guess, want, whine, and victim our way through life, we sabotage our own goals and happiness. Never use these words again. Take charge of your thoughts and speech, and your life will follow suit.</p></p><p><p>R. Neville Johnston was shot to death in 1977. He woke up in a hospital able to see people in their past lives. This NDE or "shaman's death" was just the beginning. He believes that he was sent back to assist in raising human consciousness to a higher echelon by helping us learn to speak an ascended language. He is the author of many books including <i>The Language Codes</i> and <i>Telepathic Etiquette</i>.

Are leaders born or are they made? Elizabeth D. Samet, the author of the award-winning <em>Soldier&#x2019;s Heart</em> and a professor of English at West Point, brings to this anthology her profound experiences as a teacher of soldiers, her discerning ear for excellent writing, and her belief in the vital role of the humanities in cultivating leaders. Great writers and thinkers <em>in conversation</em>&#x2015;that is what makes Samet&#x2019;s approach distinctive. Samet organizes the writings around the essence of leadership&#x2015;the insights, skills, and actions that effective leaders, with time and experience, learn to live by. What are these insights, skills, and actions? Newcomers to any organization must first study the system, then find and emulate models, risk change, cultivate trust, negotiate, take responsibility, learn from failure, learn to resist, innovate, discipline desire, and eventually let go. These ideas, brought to life in selections written by or about unforgettable leaders&#x2015;be they heroic, quixotic, or villainous&#x2015;shape the book. Machiavelli, Macbeth, and Milosz, Ghandi and Gawande, Douglass and Didion are just a sampling of the 102 writers and works included. Readers of <em>Leadership</em> will enjoy its sheer variety at the same time that they enter a thought-provoking, often moving conversation that is both ancient and crucially current.</p></p><p>Elizabeth D.

In quadruple-bunked cabins and stopover towns sprinkled across the country&#x2019;s snowy landscape, Greene speaks with ordinary Russians about how their lives have changed in the post-Soviet years.</p><p>These travels offer a glimpse of the new Russia&#x2015;a nation that boasts open elections and newfound prosperity but continues to endure oppression, corruption, a dwindling population, and stark inequality.</p><p>We follow Greene as he finds opportunity and hardship embodied in his fellow train travelers and in conversations with residents of towns throughout Siberia.</p><p>We meet Nadezhda, an entrepreneur who runs a small hotel in Ishim, fighting through corrupt layers of bureaucracy every day. Greene spends a joyous evening with a group of babushkas who made international headlines as runners-up at the Eurovision singing competition. They sing Beatles covers, alongside their traditional songs, finding that music and companionship can heal wounds from the past. In Novosibirsk, Greene has tea with Alexei, who runs the carpet company his mother began after the Soviet collapse and has mixed feelings about a government in which his family has done quite well. And in Chelyabinsk, a hunt for space debris after a meteorite landing leads Greene to a young man orphaned as a teenager, forced into military service, and now figuring out if any of his dreams are possible.</p><p><em>Midnight in Siberia</em> is a lively travel narrative filled with humor, adventure, and insight.

A storyteller with a human touch, Greene finds Russians tested by tragedy and war as he joins them in their cramped apartments, jammed trains, and gulping beer and pickled horse sausage in their steam baths, facing an uncertain future with an unexpected streak of inner wildness. His Russians are stolidly patriotic and, even now, drawn mostly to strong leaders, resigned to tough justice and preferring stability and harsh rule to the chaotic uncertainties of democracy, their personal lives &#x2018;full of poetry, pain, and laughter.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hedrick Smith, author of <em>The Russians</em> and <em>Who Stole the American Dream</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Greene is a great storyteller, and what a story he has to tell.

Such were one man's wages. Here, collected for the first time, are all the poems he published in English, from his earliest collaborations with Derek Walcott, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss, and Anthony Hecht to the moving farewell poems he wrote near the end of his life. With nearly two hundred poems, several of them never before published in book form, this will be the essential volume of Brodsky's work.</p></p><p>In his brilliant, mercurial prose, the late Joseph Brodsky insisted tirelessly on the superiority of poetry. It's ironic, then, that his own poems--at least in their English incarnations--tend to trail his own essays by a country mile. Ordinarily you might pin the blame on the usual suspects: the translators. But Derek Walcott, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss, and Anthony Hecht are hardly hacks for hire, and neither were the other hardy souls who helped Brodsky to ease his Russian verse over the linguistic hurdles. No, the problem has more to do with the poet's stubborn attachment to formalism. Determined to echo his native rhyme schemes and rapid-fire cadences--and to accommodate his marvelous, maddening proliferation of metaphors--Brodsky wrenched his English poetry into one peculiar shape after another. Even when he's half-apologizing (in "A Song to No Music") for his verbal curlicues, he manages to leave most readers scratching their heads: "Scholastics? Almost. Just as well. / God knows. Take any for a spastic / consent. For after all, pray tell, / what in this world is not scholastic?"<p> All this would be irrelevant if Brodsky were not in fact a writer of dizzying talents. The worst poems here still bear the faint impress of impacted genius, and bring to mind Randall Jarrell's famous line about Walt Whitman--that "only a man with the most extraordinary feel for language, or none whatsoever, could have cooked up [his] worst messes." And when Brodsky manages to tame his Russian accent and his addiction to Euclidean props, he's capable of enormous power. His "Elegy: For Robert Lowell" is a perfect (and very Lowell-like) example: "In the autumnal blue / of your church-hooded New / England, the porcupine / sharpens its golden needles / against Bostonian bricks / to a point of needless / blinding shine." He's also a superb observer of the natural landscape, which forces his high-velocity imagination to proceed in leisurely, lyrical increments. Hence the opening of "In England": </p><blockquote> And so you are returning, livid flesh of early dusk. The chalk<br> Sussex rocks fling seaward the smell of dry grass and<br> a long shadow, like some black useless thing. The rippling<br> sea hurls landward the roar of the incoming surge and<br> scraps of ultramarine. From the coupling of the splash of<br> needless water and needless dark arise, sharply<br> etched against the sky, spires of churches...<br> </blockquote> A caveat worth repeating: in his native Russian, Brodsky may well be one of the century's great poets. But his English-speaking audience would have benefited from a slimmed-down selection of his verse rather than the kitchen-sink approach of <i>Collected Poems</i>. And in the meantime, the essays and chalk talks collected in <i>Less Than One</i> and <i>On Grief and Reason</i> offer the best introduction to this sui generis figure, persuading even his most skeptical listeners that "truth depends on art," and not the other way around. <i>--James Marcus</i><p><b>Joseph Brodsky</b> (1940-96) came to the United States in 1972, an involuntary exile from the Soviet Union. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States in 1991 and 1992.</p></p><h2>Running with Lydiard: Greatest Running Coach of All Time</h2><p>Foreword by Terry Crawford, Director of Coaching, USATF<p> Since the outstanding success of his New Zealand athletes Snell, Halberg and Magee at the 1960 Rome Olympics, Arthur Lydiard's name has been synonymous with the best training methods used by the world's top middle- and long distance runners. His schedules precipitated an athletic revolution, stressing as they did physiological conditioning as a prerequisite to sporting effort, and long-duration even-pace running at a strong speed as the means of achieving this. While instructing runners and coaches in Finland, Mexico, Venezuela, Denmark, Japan, the United States and New Zealand for more than 50 years, Arthur Lydiard always continued to experiment and refine his methods methods that are still as relevant today as they were over half a century ago.</p><p> <i>Running With Lydiard</i> contains expanded information on exercise physiology, diet, injury prevention and cure, discussion of Lydiard's methods and revised training schedules.</p></p><p>New Zealander Arthur Lydiard was the most successful trainer of middle- and long-distance running in the world. He coached runners from different countries, such as Peter Snell (three times gold) or Lasse Viren (four times gold). In the 50s and 60s Arthur Lydiard not only revolutionized the middle- and long-distance training, but parallel to this development he may be considered as one of the founders of the jogging movement.Garth Gilmour is a journalist and was Lydiard&#39;s co-author since 1960.

But now in Shadow of My Father, the real story of the King of the Volcano is revealed for the first time. John A. Gotti who survived four trials and a parole violation hearing without a guilty verdict, in four years, now takes up his pen to tell the story of his father&#x2019;s unwavering dedication to the street, and how as his son he entered that life and then with his father&#x2019;s permission left the life of crime and put the &#x201c;Family&#x201d; behind him to live a legitimate life with his real family. It is a saga of betrayal and redemption, and an insider&#x2019;s view of how at times those who are tasked with upholding the law readily broke it to further their careers. </p> <p>FROM THE FOREWORD:</p> <p><i> As colorful and tragic as Gotti Sr&#x2019;s life was, the self-told chronicle of his son&#x2019;s odyssey reads like an epic worthy of Victor Hugo. As far back as 1998 John A. &#x201c;Junior&#x201d; Gotti declared himself a &#x201c;civilian&#x201d; and with his father&#x2019;s permission withdrew from the Life. But over the next ten years the Justice Department refused to let that happen.</i><i><br> </i></p> <p><i>After he&#x2019;d served nearly six and a half years and paid millions in fines, the DOJ came after him again with four trials and a tax prosecution&#x2014;five, not four&#x2014;attempts to send him away for life. One indictment even included a death penalty eligible crime. But in the end, Gotti Junior proved to be &#x201c;The Teflon Son.&#x201d;<br> </i></p> <p><i>To wage their relentless series of prosecutions the Feds used some fifteen Assistant U.S. Attorneys and more than a hundred cooperating witnesses, many of whom were violent felony offenders who had, in the aggregate, committed nearly a hundred murders and hundreds of assaults and robberies. Then, after testifying, those violent criminals soon got their freedom and many of them were released to the streets with the help and support of their government handlers.</i><br> </p></p><p></p><h2>Tarot - the Open Reading</h2><p>The object of this book is threefold.

This development is not an isolated or recent phenomenon. Western society is based on a rebellion against God and the natural and moral order. The so-called &#x201c;Enlightenment&#x201d; refers to Lucifer as the &#x201c;light giver.&#x201d; It was an assertion of the Illuminati's determination to reject Reality -- the Creator's Design &#x2013; and construct an artificial reality more conducive to their interests and perversions. This is what the Cabalist bankers mean by &#x201c;remaking the world&#x201d; or &#x201c;changing the world.&#x201d; There is no way to sugarcoat this. Satanist (Cabalist) Jews and Freemasons are waging a covert war against God and man and are close to achieving victory. Many Jews and Freemasons have been a subversive force throughout history - the real reason for anti Semitism. Of course, the majority of Jews (and Christians) aren't aware of this process of satanic possession. We have all succumbed to it. Passing as &#x201c;secularism&#x201d; and &#x201c;humanism,&#x201d; Satanism is the secret religion of the West.</p><p></p><h2>The Mass of Brother Michel</h2><p><p><b>-- <i>The Mass of Brother Michel</i> is a gripping story of adventure, renunciation, redemption, and ultimate victory. No reader will fail to be touched by its inspiring and miraculous climax.</b></p> <p><i>The Mass of Brother Michel</i>, set in the tranquil countryside of southern France during the Reformation, is the story of a young man who &#x201c;has it all&#x201d;&#x2014;until a fateful series of events leads him to a monastery. As Huguenot violence mounts, the characters of the story are pushed to extremes of hatred and love. The reader is swept along by a narrative as twisting and turbulent as a mountain stream, which culminates in a sovereign sacrifice as unforgettable as it was unforeseen. This is a story that shows with utter vividness the power of romantic love to cripple and deform, the power of suffering to undermine illusions and induce the labor of self-discovery, the power of prayer to reassemble the shards of the shattered image of God in the soul, and the power of the priest as the divine Physician&#x2019;s privileged instrument.</p> <p>At the center of the novel is the awesome mystery, scandal, consolation, and provocation of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. To it some of the characters are irresistibly drawn; against it, others are violently arrayed. Here is a passionately told tale of their inner struggle and outward confrontation. <i>The Mass of Brother Michel</i> is a gripping story of adventure, renunciation, redemption, and ultimate victory. No reader will fail to be astonished at its outcome and touched by its inspiring and miraculous climax.</p> <p>&#x201c;In <i>The Mass of Brother Michel</i> we have a work that should be shouted about in the marketplace and forced into the hands of those who think that the age of fine writing has passed away. It ought to be not only the Catholic Book of the Month but the Book of the Year.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Sign</i></p> <p>&#x201c;In style and conception the book is distinguished throughout; it re-creates skillfully the life of the period; it is dramatic and tense, and the author&#x2019;s wit plays happily over every scene and character. Michael Kent has a rare gift for distilling the stuff of drama and romance that mark the ways of God with man.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Catholic World</i></p> <p>&#x201c;A really entertaining novel that is also a religious work is hard to find. This is a story of sixteenth-century France, of the volatile de Guillemonts, and of Michel, whose love for Louise conflicts with his love of the Mass. Fine qualities and base, family feuds and jealousies, all enter in to give the story substance.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><p></p><h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank: Stories</h2><p><p>From the Pulitzer-nominated, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges,&nbsp;</i>eight powerful stories, dazzling in their display of language and imagination.<br><br>From the title story, a provocative portrait of two marriages inspired by Raymond Carver&#x2019;s masterpiece, to &#x201c;Peep Show&#x201d; and &#x201c;How We Avenged the Blums,&#x201d; two stories that return to the author&#x2019;s classic themes of sexual longing and ingenuity in the face of adversity, these stories affirm Nathan Englander&#x2019;s place at the very forefront of contemporary American fiction.</p></p><p><p>Nathan Englander is the author of the novel&nbsp;<i>The Ministry of Special Cases</i>&nbsp;and the story collections&nbsp;<i>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</i>, a winner of the Frank O&#x2019;Connor International Short Story Award, and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

Mark and Lauren live in Jerusalem, and people from there think it gives them the right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark is looking all stoic and nodding his head. &#x201c;If we had what you have down here in South Florida . . . ,&#x201d; he says, and trails off. &#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; he says, and he&#x2019;s nodding again. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d have no troubles at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You <i>do </i>have what we have,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;All of it. Sun and palm trees. Old Jews and oranges and the worst drivers around. At this point,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve probably got more Israelis than you.&#x201d; Debbie, my wife, she puts a hand on my arm. Her signal that I&#x2019;m taking a tone, or interrupting someone&#x2019;s story, sharing something private, or making an inappropriate joke. That&#x2019;s my cue, and I&#x2019;m surprised, considering how much I get it, that she ever lets go of my arm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;ve got it all now,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Even terrorists.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look to Lauren. She&#x2019;s the one my wife has the relation- ship with&#x2014;the one who should take charge. But Lauren isn&#x2019;t going to give her husband any signal. She and Mark ran off to Israel twenty years ago and turned Hassidic, and neither of them will put a hand on the other in public. Not for this. Not to put out a fire.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t Mohamed Atta living right here before 9/11?&#x201d; Mark says, and now he pantomimes pointing out houses. &#x201c;Goldberg, Goldberg, Goldberg&#x2014;Atta. How&#x2019;d you miss him in this place?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Other side of town,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about. That&#x2019;s what you have that we don&#x2019;t. Other sides of town. Wrong sides of the tracks. Space upon space.&#x201d; And now he&#x2019;s fingering a granite countertop in our kitchen, looking out into the living room and the dining room, staring through the kitchen windows out at the pool. &#x201c;All this house,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;and one son? Can you imagine?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Lauren says. And then she turns to us, backing him up. &#x201c;You should see how we live with ten.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ten kids,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;We could get you a reality show with that here in the States. Help you get a bigger place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The hand is back pulling at my sleeve. &#x201c;Pictures,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;I want to see the girls.&#x201d; We all follow Lauren into the den for her purse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you believe it?&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Ten girls!&#x201d; And the way it comes out of his mouth, it&#x2019;s the first time I like the guy. The first time I think about giving him a chance.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> Facebook and Skype brought Deb and Lauren back together. They were glued at the hip growing up. Went to school together their whole lives. Yeshiva school. All girls. Out in Queens through high school and then riding the subway together to one called Central in Manhattan. They stayed best friends forever until I married Deb and turned her secular, and soon after that Lauren met Mark and they went off to the Holy Land and went from Orthodox to <i>ultra</i>-Orthodox, which to me sounds like a repackaged detergent&#x2014;ORTHODOX ULTRA�, now with more deep-healing power. Because of that, we&#x2019;re sup- posed to call them Shoshana and Yerucham. Deb&#x2019;s been doing it. I&#x2019;m just not saying their names.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want some water?&#x201d; I offer. &#x201c;Coke in the can?&#x201d; &#x201c; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;&#x2014;which of us?&#x201d; Mark says. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>You </i>both,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got whiskey. Whiskey&#x2019;s kosher, too,<br> right?&#x201d; &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not, I&#x2019;ll kosher it up real fast,&#x201d; he says, pretending<br> to be easygoing. And right then, he takes off that big black hat and plops down on the couch in the den.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lauren&#x2019;s holding the verticals aside and looking out at the yard. &#x201c;Two girls from Forest Hills,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Who ever thought we&#x2019;d be the mothers of grown-ups?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Trevor&#x2019;s sixteen,&#x201d; Deb says. &#x201c;You may think he&#x2019;s a grown-up, and he may think he&#x2019;s a grown-up&#x2014;but we, we are not convinced.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Lauren says, &#x201c;then whoever thought we&#x2019;d have kids raised to think it&#x2019;s normal to have coconuts crashing out back and lizards climbing the walls?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Right then is when Trev comes padding into the den, all six feet of him, plaid pajama bottoms dragging on the floor and T-shirt full of holes. He&#x2019;s just woken up and you can tell he&#x2019;s not sure if he&#x2019;s still dreaming. We told him we had guests. But there&#x2019;s Trev, staring at this man in the black suit, a beard rest- ing on the middle of his stomach. And Lauren, I&#x2019;d met her once before, right when Deb and I got married, but ten girls and a thousand Shabbos dinners later&#x2014;well, she&#x2019;s a big woman, in a bad dress and a giant blond Marilyn Monroe wig. Seeing them at the door, I can&#x2019;t say I wasn&#x2019;t shocked myself. But the boy, he can&#x2019;t hide it on his face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Deb&#x2019;s on him, preening and fixing his hair and hugging him. &#x201c;Trevy, this is my best friend from childhood,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;This is Shoshana, and this is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mark,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yerucham,&#x201d; Mark says, and sticks out a hand. Trev shakes it. Then Trev sticks out his hand, polite, to Lauren. She looks at it, just hanging there in the air&#x2014;offered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t shake,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m so happy to see you. Like meeting my own son. I mean it,&#x201d; she says. And here she starts to cry, for real. And she and Deb are hugging and Deb&#x2019;s crying, too. And the boys, we just stand there until Mark looks at his watch and gets himself a good manly grip on Trev&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sleeping until three on a Sunday? Man, those were the days,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;A regular little Rumpleforeskin.&#x201d; Trev looks at me, and I want to shrug, but Mark&#x2019;s also looking, so I don&#x2019;t move. Trev just gives us both his best teenage glare and edges out of the room. As he does, he says, &#x201c;Baseball practice,&#x201d; and takes my car keys off the hook by the door to the garage.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s gas,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;They let them drive here at sixteen?&#x201d; Mark says. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Insane.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what brings you,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;after all these years?&#x201d; Deb&#x2019;s too far away to grab at me, but her face says it all. &#x201c;Was I sup- posed to know?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Jeez, Deb must have told me. She told me, for sure. My fault.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My mother,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s failing and my father&#x2019;s get- ting old&#x2014;and they come to us for Sukkot every year. You know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know the holidays,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They used to fly out to us. For Sukkot and Pesach, both. But they can&#x2019;t fly now, and I just wanted to get over while things are still good. We haven&#x2019;t been in America&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, gosh,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid to think how long it&#x2019;s been. More than ten years. Twelve,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Twelve years ago. With the kids, it&#x2019;s just impossible until enough of them are big. This might be&#x201d;&#x2014;and now she plops down on the couch&#x2014;&#x201c;this might be my first time in a house with no kids under the roof in that long. Oh my. I&#x2019;m serious. How weird. I feel faint. And when I say <i>faint</i>,&#x201d; she says, standing up, giving an oddly girlish spin around, &#x201c;what I mean is giddy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do you do it?&#x201d; Deb says. &#x201c;Ten kids? I really do want to hear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s when I remember. &#x201c;I forgot your drink,&#x201d; I say to Mark.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, his drink. That&#x2019;s how,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how we cope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> And that&#x2019;s how the four of us end up back at the kitchen table with a bottle of vodka between us. I&#x2019;m not one to get drunk on a Sunday afternoon, but I tell you, with a plan to spend the day with Mark, I jump at the chance. Deb&#x2019;s drinking, too, but not for the same reason. For her and Lauren, I think they&#x2019;re reliving a little bit of the wild times. The very small window when they were together, barely grown-up, two young women living in New York on the edge of two worlds. And they just look, the both of them, so overjoyed to be reunited, I think they&#x2019;re half celebrating and half can&#x2019;t handle how intense the whole thing is.<br> Deb says, as she&#x2019;s already on her second, &#x201c;This is really racy for us. I mean <i>really </i>racy. We try not to drink much at all these days. We think it sets a bad example for Trevor. It&#x2019;s not good to drink in front of them right at that age when they&#x2019;re all transgressive. He&#x2019;s suddenly so interested in that kind of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just happy when he&#x2019;s interested in something,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deb slaps at the air. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s good to make drinking look like it&#x2019;s fun with a teenager around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lauren smiles and straightens her wig. &#x201c;Does anything we do look fun to our kids?&#x201d; I laugh at that. Honestly, I&#x2019;m really liking her more and more.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the age limit that does it,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the whole American puritanical thing, the twenty-one-year-old drinking age and all that. We don&#x2019;t make a big deal about it in Israel, and so the kids, they don&#x2019;t even notice alcohol. Except for the foreign workers on Fridays, you hardly see anyone drunk at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The workers and the Russians,&#x201d; Lauren says.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Russian immigrants,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s a whole sepa- rate matter. Most of them, you know, not even Jews.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It means matrilineal descent, is what it means,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;It means with the Ethiopians there were conversions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Deb wants to keep us away from politics, and the way we&#x2019;re arranged, me in between them and Deb opposite (it&#x2019;s a round table, our kitchen table), she practically has to throw her- self across to grab hold of my arm. &#x201c;Fix me another,&#x201d; she says.<br> &nbsp;<br> And here she switches the subject to Mark&#x2019;s parents. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the visit been going?&#x201d; she says, her face all somber. &#x201c;How are your folks holding up?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Deb is very interested in Mark&#x2019;s parents. They&#x2019;re Holocaust survivors. And Deb has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with the idea of that generation being gone. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. It&#x2019;s important to me, too. I care, too. All I&#x2019;m saying is, there&#x2019;s healthy and unhealthy, and my wife, she gives this subject a lot, <i>a lot</i>, of time. &#x201c;Do you know,&#x201d; she&#x2019;ll say to me and Trevor, just absolutely out of nowhere, &#x201c;World War Two veterans die at a rate of a thousand a day?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What can I say?&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s a very sick woman. And my father, he tries to keep his spirits up. He&#x2019;s a tough guy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; I say. And then I look in my drink, all serious, and give a shake of my head. &#x201c;They really are amazing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Fathers?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look back up and they&#x2019;re all three staring at me. &#x201c;Survivors,&#x201d; I say, seeing I jumped the gun.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s good and bad,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Like anyone else.&#x201d; And then he laughs. &#x201c;Though there isn&#x2019;t anyone else in my par- ents&#x2019; place.&#x201d;<br> Lauren says, &#x201c;You should see it. The whole of Carmel Lake Village, it&#x2019;s like a DP camp with a billiards room. They&#x2019;re all there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One tells the other,&#x201d; Marks says, &#x201c;and they follow. It&#x2019;s amazing. From Europe to New York, and now, for the end of their lives, again the same place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell them that crazy story,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;Tell them, Yuri.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell us,&#x201d; Deb says. And I can see in her eyes that she wants it to be one of those stories of a guy who spent three years hiding inside one of those cannons they use for the circus. And at the end of the war, a Righteous Gentile comes out all joyous and fires him through a hoop and into a tub of water, where he discovers his lost son breathing through a straw.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So you can picture my father,&#x201d; Mark says, &#x201c;in the old country, he went to <i>heder</i>, had the peyes and all that. But in America, a classic <i>galusmonger</i>. He looks more like you than me. It&#x2019;s not from him that I get this,&#x201d; he says, pointing at his beard. &#x201c;Shoshana and I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We know,&#x201d; I say.<br> &#x201c;So my father. They&#x2019;ve got a nice nine-hole course, a driving range, some greens for the practice putting. And my dad, he&#x2019;s at the clubhouse. I go with him. He wants to work out in the gym, he says. Tells me I should come. Get some exercise. And he tells me&#x201d;&#x2014;and here Mark points at his feet, sliding a leg out from under the table so we can see his big black clodhoppers&#x2014;&#x201c;&#x2018;You can&#x2019;t wear those Shabbos shoes on the treadmill. You need the sneakers. You know, sports shoes?&#x2019; he says. And I tell him, &#x2018;I know what sneakers are. I didn&#x2019;t forget my English any more than your Yiddish is gone.&#x2019; And so he says, &#x2018;<i>Ah shaynem dank dir in pupik</i>.&#x2019; Just to show me who&#x2019;s who.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The point,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;Tell them the point.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So he&#x2019;s sitting in the locker room, trying to pull a sock on, which is, at that age, basically the whole workout in itself. It&#x2019;s no quick business. And I see, while I&#x2019;m waiting, and I can&#x2019;t believe it. I nearly pass out. The guy next to him, the number on his arm, it&#x2019;s three before my father&#x2019;s number. You know, in sequence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Deb says.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I mean, the number tattooed. It&#x2019;s the same as my father&#x2019;s camp number, digit for digit, but my father&#x2019;s ends in an eight. And this guy&#x2019;s, it ends in a five. That&#x2019;s the only difference. I mean, they&#x2019;re separated by two people. And I look at this guy. I&#x2019;ve never seen him before in my life. So I say, &#x2018;Excuse me, sir&#x2019; to the guy. And he just says, &#x2018;You with the Chabad? I don&#x2019;t want anything but to be left alone. I already got candles at home.&#x2019; I tell him, &#x2018;No. I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m here visiting my father.&#x2019; And to my father, I say, &#x2018;Do you know this gentleman? Have you two met? I&#x2019;d really like to introduce you, if you haven&#x2019;t.&#x2019; And they look each other over for what, I promise you, is minutes. Actual minutes. It is&#x2014;with <i>kavod</i> I say this, with respect for my father&#x2014; but it is like watching a pair of big beige manatees sitting on a bench, each with one sock on. They&#x2019;re just looking each other up and down, everything slow. And then my father says, &#x2018;I seen him. Seen him around.&#x2019; The other guy, he says, &#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;ve seen.&#x2019; &#x2018;You&#x2019;re both survivors,&#x2019; I tell them. &#x2018;Look, look,&#x2019; I say. &#x2018;The numbers.&#x2019; And they look. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re the same,&#x2019; I say. And they both hold out their arms to look at the little ashen tattoos. &#x2018;The same,&#x2019; I tell them. And to my father, I say, &#x2018;Do you get it? The same, except his&#x2014;his, it&#x2019;s right ahead of yours. Look! Compare.&#x2019; So they look. They compare.&#x201d; And to us now, Mark&#x2019;s eyes are pop- ping out of his head. &#x201c;I mean, think about it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Around the world, surviving the unsurvivable, these two old guys end up with enough money to retire to Carmel Lake and play golf every day. So I say to my dad, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s right ahead of you,&#x2019; I say. &#x2018;Look, a five,&#x2019; I say. &#x2018;And yours is an eight.&#x2019; And the other guy looks and my father looks, and my father says, &#x2018;All that means is, he cut ahead of me in line. There, same as here. This guy&#x2019;s a cutter, I just didn&#x2019;t want to say.&#x2019; &#x2018;Blow it out your ear,&#x2019; the other guy says. And that&#x2019;s it.

I answered that I was about to embark on a book that would examine what it means to live consciously. </p><p> An older woman, her face lined with bitterness, frowned and shook her head disapprovingly. "Live consciously?" she said. "Not a good idea. Who would want to live consciously? Life would be too painful." </p><p> I asked, "Is it less painful if we live unconsciously and mechanically, without knowing what we are doing, and blind to opportunities to make things better?" But she did not answer. </p><p> Someone else at the table remarked, "Well, even if living consciously does have advantages -- isn't it still a lot of <i>work?"</i> </p><p> </p><blockquote><b>Like a light that can be turned brighter or dimmer, consciousness exists on a continuum.</b></blockquote> <p> It is true that living consciously obliges us at times to confront painful realities. It is also true that it demands an effort. As a way Of operating in the world, living consciously has its costs, and we will examine them. A central theme of this book, however, is that the rewards are overwhelmingly greater than any apparent drawback. Living consciously is a source of power and liberation. It does not weigh us down -- it lifts us up. </p><p> Like a light that can be turned brighter or dimmer, consciousness exists on a continuum. We can be more conscious or less conscious, more aware or less aware. So the choice is not between absolute optimal consciousness and literal unconsciousness (as in a coma). The choice is between living more consciously and less consciously. Or we might say: between living consciously and living mechanically. And it is always a matter of degree. </p><p> The tragedy of so many people is precisely that, to a great extent, they live mechanically: their thinking is stale, . they don't examine their motives, and they respond to events automatically. They rarely take a fresh look at anything and rarely have a new thought. They exist at a low or shallow level of awareness. One of the consequences is that they live lives drained of color, excitement, or passion. It is not difficult to see that consciousness energizes, while its absence produces boredom and enervation. </p><p> To live consciously is to be committed to awareness as a way of being in the world and to bring to each activity a level of awareness appropriate to it. But what this means is not obvious. "Living consciously" is an enormous abstraction. We will examine its meaning in the chapters that follow. </p><p> I use <i>consciousness</i> here in its primary meaning: the state of being conscious or aware of some aspect of reality. Why is consciousness important? The short answer is that for all species that possess it, consciousness is the basic tool of survival and of adaptation to reality -- the ability to be aware of the environment in some way, at some level, and to guide action accordingly. One might as well ask: Why is sight important? </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>Living consciously is a state of being mentally active rather than passive. It is the ability to look at the worm through fresh eyes. It is intelligence taking joy in its own function. Living consciously is seeking to be aware of everything that bears on our interests, actions, values, purposes, and goals. It is the willingness to confront facts, pleasant or unpleasant. It is the desire to discover our mistakes and correct them. Within the range of our interests and concerns, it is the quest to keep expanding our awareness and understanding, both of the world external to self and of the worm within. It is respect for reality and respect for the distinction between the real and the unreal. It is the commitment to see what we see and know what we know. It is recognition that the act of dismissing reality is the root of all evil.</i></blockquote> <p> The issue of living consciously versus unconsciously takes many forms. Here are two examples taken from my practice of psychotherapy, in which we can see what living <i>un</i>consciously may look like. Note that these examples merely illustrate the problem; they do not yet suggest the path to a solution. </p><p> </p><blockquote>Arnold K. was a forty-seven-year-old professor of history who imagined he was deeply in love with his wife and was unkind to her in a hundred ways he did not notice. When she needed to talk to him about something of importance to her, he typically was preoccupied, only half listened, and rarely responded in any meaningful way. When she expressed a desire, he smiled and said nothing and soon drifted off to another subject. When she disagreed with him, he swung off into another monologue without dealing with what she had said. When she tried to tell him of ways he hurt her, he did not hear, or apologized instantly and forgot her words within an hour. He knew how devoted he felt, so he believed he was a loving husband. And when the mood struck, he could be truly generous, considerate, and caring. Essentially, however, he lived in a private cocoon that contained himself and his love for her and his image of her but not the actual woman: she was exiled to that foreign realm, reality. So that in real-world terms, she was not part of his marriage. His wife was not the woman he lived with; he lived with a fantasy existing only inside his head. In some subjective sense of his own he may have loved her, but he did not love her <i>consciously,</i> did not day by day give the relationship the awareness it needed and deserved. Eventually she became ill and abruptly was gone from his life. Standing at her graveside in agony, he saw that during the twelve years of their marriage he had not been there -- he had been lost inside his own mind. He saw that he had abandoned his wife long before she had "abandoned" him (by dying). What love had not accomplished, death had accomplished: jolted him into waking up, at least for a time.</blockquote> <p> For many of us, suffering is the only teacher to whom we listen. In Arnold's case, as with the case below, suffering precipitated the decision to seek psychotherapy. </p><p> </p><blockquote>Rebecca L. was a thirty-nine-year-old leader of personal growth workshops. She saw herself as a person who was on a spiritual path and who had attained a high level of consciousness, yet she was oblivious to the wreckage she had created in her family life. Her lofty view of herself was based on the fact that she was a student of the <i>I Ching,</i> took classes in Tantric Yoga, immersed herself in the literature of the contemplative traditions, and had had thirteen years of Jungian analysis. She subjected her two teenage daughters to endless hours of psychological interpretation of their behavior. At dinner she would invite her husband to tell his dreams, which she would then proceed to analyze. If any of her interpretations were challenged, she would respond with gentle compassion; if the challenge persisted, she became first irritated and then increasingly angry -- until everyone retreated into sullen exhaustion. She could quote interminably from many spiritual masters and had no idea that in the privacy of their bedroom her daughters would sometimes talk about how pleasant life could be if only mother would die. Her husband did not appear to indulge in daydreams; he merely barricaded himself behind his work and spent as little time alone with her as possible. She moved through her life in a kind of trance while priding herself on being more "awake," more "conscious," than those around her. She could not understand why she so often felt a vague, generalized anxiety.</blockquote> <p> Neither of these people was asleep in the literal sense, and neither was awake in the sense required for a successful life. Their stories give us a preliminary sense of the territory we need to explore -- or, more precisely, certain aspects of it; we will see that there fire many others. </p><p> Sometimes, when we reflect on our life and on the mistakes we have made and regretted, it seems to us we were sleeping when we imagined we were awake. We wonder how we could have failed to see that which now stands out in such bold relief. Of course, this may be self-deceiving, in that hindsight always sees more clearly. At that earlier time, we may have been as conscious as we knew how to be. </p><p> However, sometimes our sense of having been sleepwalking through our existence reflects an accurate assessment. We know we were not mindful when we needed to be. Our awareness was diffuse or distracted rather than focused and disciplined. No doubt there were reasons, but reasons do not alter facts. In retrospect, we wish we had been more conscious. </p><p> We think, for example of all the danger signals we had ignored at the start of what turned out to be a disastrous love affair -- for example, our lover's incongruous behavior, conflicting statements, mysterious nonexplanations, sudden and inexplicable emotional outbursts. We ask ourselves, Where was my mind at the time? Or we remember all the warnings our supervisor gave us long before we were discharged, and we wonder why the words did not penetrate. Or we reflect on the opportunities we let slip by because in our trancelike state we did not appreciate them for what they were, and we ask ourselves how that was possible. Where was I, we wonder, when my life was happening? </p><p> When I discussed the practice of living consciously in previous books, it was exclusively from the perspective of its importance to self-esteem. Here, the focus is wider. What does it mean to act consciously? To love consciously? To parent consciously? To feel consciously? To Work consciously? To struggle consciously? To vote consciously? To legislate consciously? To address the great issues of life consciously? </p><p> To offer an example from the political realm: When legislators pass laws on the expediency of the moment, such as price and wage controls, without thinking through the long-term, foreseeable consequences of their programs, which unfortunately is the pattern of most legislation -- and the results are worse than the problem the ...</p></p><h2>Mcguire&#x2019;s Irish Pub Cookbook (Restaurant Cookbooks)</h2><p><p>For more than thirty-five years, McGuire's Irish Pub has been serving authentic fare to its customers in Pensacola, Florida.

The place overflows with Irish hospitality and charm, just like any Irish pub--although it happens to be a 20,000-square-foot restaurant in Florida.

There are also wilder fancies, including Chicken Timbales with Orange Tarragon Cream, which only ambitious home chefs are likely to tackle. McGuire's really excels at recipes that give a creative twist to traditional Irish fare. Witness the Bean Soup--thick with three kinds of melted cheese--and a dense black bean chili made with stout.

The craft of icon-making is set into the context of forms of worship that emerged in the Russian Orthodox Church in the mid-seventeenth century. Oleg Tarasov shows how icons have held a special place in Russian consciousness because they represented idealized images of Holy Russia. He also looks closely at how and why icons were made. Wonder-working saints and the leaders of such religious schisms as the Old Believers appear in these pages, which are illustrated with miniature paintings, lithographs and engravings never before published in the English-speaking world.<br><br>By tracing the artistic vocabulary, techniques and working methods of icon painters, Tarasov shows how icons have been integral to the history of Russian art, influenced by folk and mainstream currents alike. As well as articulating the specifically Russian piety they invoke, he analyzes the significance of icons in the cultural life of modern Russia in the context of popular prints and poster design.</p><p><b>Oleg Tarasov</b> is Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Cultural History of the Institute of Slavic Studies (Russian Academy of Sciences), Moscow.

God knows that they do not do it for the money nor do they do it for the recognition. They do it because they believe in the work, and because they know, as I do, that there really are monsters in the world, and someone has to protect us from them.</p><p>It is also not an argument against the existence of a central human intelligence collection organization within the United States Government. We desperately needed a central intelligence agency in 1947 when the CIA was created. We even more desperately need such an entity today. The threats facing us are multiplying and becoming more complex. The time horizons in which threats are emerging are shortening. Technology is evolving at an astonishing rate, and we really are fast approaching the day when there will be dozens of groups and nations on this planet capable of threatening us with biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear weapons. This is not pulp fiction. This is reality.</p><p>This book is an argument that the existing Central Intelligence Agency is no longer capable of performing the task for which it was designed and must, rapidly, be replaced. </p></p><p>Once upon a time, the CIA took the risks necessary to protect America. &#x201c;If you fall,&#x201d; went its mantra, &#x201c;fall forward.&#x201d; In <i>Beyond Repair,</i> one of the agency&#x2019;s most respected former operatives mounts a scathing cri�tique of the preparedness of today&#x2019;s CIA&#x2014;and, spe�cifically, the Directorate of Operations at its core&#x2014;to defend America against the dizzying dangers of the twenty-first century. In a compelling blend of analy�sis and fascinating true-life stories, Charles S. Faddis argues that the CIA has devolved into a low-risk or, often, no-risk bureaucracy of careerists whose mantra might be summed up thus: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fall.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Every senior officer I know in the CIA carries personal liability insurance,&#x201d; writes Faddis, &#x201c;because of the fear of being sued for actions taken in the line of duty.&#x201d; And, he notes, no operatives who commanded CIA teams in Afghanistan have been promoted to key positions. Why? Because they operate within a system that is no longer built to encourage and reward the risk taking and creativity they excelled at. <br><br>Faddis discusses the birth of the CIA&#x2014;then called the Office of Strategic Services&#x2014;during World War II under &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; Donovan, the twentieth-century American father of spy craft. Donovan&#x2019;s daring would not get him far in today&#x2019;s CIA, Faddis observes. Describing how the twenty-first-century CIA works from the inside out, he paints an unsettling picture of an agency that has truly gone awry&#x2014;recalling, for example, his own experience in a Middle Eastern country as a chief of station without a qualified Arabic linguist on hand.<br><br>Faddis concludes by setting forth the main points of a plan for building a new entity. He proposes that this agency draw on the best qualities of the OSS (and readopt its name) while adapting to twenty-first-century needs, and that it be staffed by many of the CIA&#x2019;s finest men and women. This new agency would maintain the midnight watch, so Americans can sleep well at night.<br><br><br>An insider&#x2019;s account of why the CIA is ill prepared to protect America, and why it must be replaced without delay<br><br>Praise for <i>Beyond Repair <br></i><br><i>&#x201c;If you want to know what&#x2019;s wrong with today&#x2019;s CIA&#x2014;and how to fix it&#x2014;this book is the place to start. Faddis . . . describes the timidity of station chiefs terrified of getting blamed for mistakes, the obduracy of ambassadors who don&#x2019;t want flaps, the &#x2018;we&#x2019;re all winners here&#x2019; training rules better suited for a kindergarten playground than intelligence work, the reluctance to hire and promote people who understand leadership. You read </i>Beyond Repair <i>and you realize: No wonder the CIA is screwed up ! . . . If people would read this book and understand its message, it could save lives.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x2014;David Ignatius, <i>Washington Post</i> columnist and author of <i>Body of Lies <br></i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Drawing on his unique experience as a CIA operations officer, Charles Faddis makes a compelling case in </i>Beyond Repair<i> that the CIA must return to its Office of Strategic Services (OSS) roots to provide the United States with the intelligence it needs. Faddis has a deep appreciation for the OSS and great admiration for its legendary leader, General William J. Donovan, who frequently told OSS personnel that they could not succeed without taking chances. Faddis has taken such chances himself. General Donovan could have written this book. I know he would <br>have read it and agreed wholeheartedly with its conclusion.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x2014;Charles Pinck, President of The OSS Society<br></p><h2>Caleb Vigilant (Chronicles of the Nephilim)</h2><p><b>Giant Walls Will Come Tumbling Down</b><br><br>In this companion volume to Joshua Valiant, the story of the conquest of the Promised Land of Canaan continues.<br><br>Joshua's first target in Canaan: The impenetrable mighty walls of Jericho.<br><br>God has been preparing a Canaanite harlot named Rahab to help Israel.<br><br>You only think you know her story.<br><br>Rahab has fallen in love with an Israelite warrior whose child she bears in the line of Messiah.<br>Unfortunately, the Anakim giants of Canaan have discovered Rahab's identity and have sent assassins to take her out.<br><br>This is what the War of the Seed has been building towards.<br><br>Caleb Vigilant is the sixth book of the series Chronicles of the Nephilim, a biblical epic story of the fallen angelic Watchers and their offspring, the Nephilim giants of Genesis 6.<br><br>Written by respected Christian and best-selling Biblical author, Brian Godawa.<br><br><b>Learn About the Historical and Biblical Research Behind the Novel</b><br>Caleb Vigilant as an appendix that explores how the Bible writers used their literary skills to subvert the pagan god Ba'al of Canaan.<br><br><b>On The Age Appropriateness Of The Novels</b><br>This Biblical Fiction series is rated PG-13, appropriate for mature teens and above, similar to the Bible and The Lord of the Rings.</p><p>Brian Godawa is the screenwriter for the award-winning feature film, To End All Wars, starring Kiefer Sutherland, and Alleged, starring Brian Dennehy as Clarence Darrow and Fred Thompson as William Jennings Bryan.

She studied Fashion at Central Saint Martins, accidentally had a London based career as an Art Director in advertising, then completed an MA at University of Brighton in Illustration.

Follow her on Twitter @sophyhenn.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;In the vein of Olivia and Eloise, this clever, tongue-in-cheek story will have audiences laughing aloud. Edie enumerates the many ways in which she "helps out," while the pictures tell an entirely different story. She puts her shoes on (the wrong feet), organizes Mommy's office (by wildly decorating her desk) etc., and finally "helps" by "brightening the place up a bit" (painting on the walls) at which point our narrator says "Sometimes I have to remember NOT to be quite so helpful." Finally, she recalls "exactly how helpful I should be" and gives hugs, reads to her brother, and behaves...mostly. The clever story moves along at a good clip, encouraging page turns and leaving plenty of room for the illustrations to expand the plot. The colorful, naive illustrations are reminiscent of Christian Robinson's, complete with black oval eyes, lots of white space, and a use of bold retro colors. Henn takes advantage of the layout, using spot art to provide movement, visually tell the story, and match Edie's exuberance. There are many small vignettes on stark white backgrounds, but periodically they lead into full-bleed spreads, emphasizing the action. Edie is always clearly visible in her pom-pom hat, black skirt, and mustard-colored top. Despite the simplicity of the faces, Henn manages to portray emotions extremely effectively, with only a few facial lines and body positioning. VERDICT Sure to be a big hit, this delightful story will be enjoyed one-on-one while also making an excellent read-aloud in storytime.&#x2014;Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</p><h2>Hiding My Candy: The Autobiography of the Grand Empress of Savannah</h2><p>After leaping off the pages with he unforgettable debut in John Berendt's bestselling <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>, the unabashed personality known as The Lady Chablis now brings her irresistible charisma to the remarkable odyssey of fabulousness that USA Today calls "sassy" and "provocative...." <br>Born Benjamin Edward Knox in Quincy, Florida, "The Doll" always knew she was different. At a Tallahassee club, in her teens, she found the drag mother who would set her on the path to stardom. Before long, The Lady Chablis had a headline drag act replete with trademark saucy wit, down-home wisdom, and, of course, breasts. The rest is "Miss Thang" history....</p><p>Theodore Bouloukos is a freelance writer who lives in New York City.<b>From Chapter</b><p>Sunday services were a major part of our lives. It was an all day affair, and that was just fine with me. It was my time to perform, see: I was an usher and, impressively, an <i>Assistant Superintendent of the sunday school</i>. I was the kid selected to make all the speeches and social announcements in front of the crowd. The congregation loved that as much as I did, 'cause they knew I was gonna give 'em <i>gestures</i> with it. My emphasis was on <i>performance</i>, honey -- standing tall and stabbing away at elocution -- regardless of whether the message was 'bout Bingo Night or the monthly church picnic. So, was this where The Doll first learned to perfect her stage presence? Well, it was certainly where she learned to monopolize an audience!</p><p>I was the first <i>openly and flamboyantly</i> "gay" person I knew of in my hometown. That being the way, I guess I was protected by my family, much the way a retarded child is looked after. I mean, Gran'mama knew I was a sissy, and while I don't think she liked it, her boundless love for me would never have allowed her to harp on the fact that I needed to make drastic changes. Besides, she didn't believe in tampering with what was purely the Lord's business. And she made sure I knew that a higher power ultimately called the shots.</p><p>From very early on I guess, it was my strong, abiding faith in Jesus Christ above that helped me understand myself most, at least according to the ways that I felt I was "different" from the other li'l boys. As far as I could reckon, and no matter what anybody else thought, I was really a li'l girl -- <i>with candy</i> -- just like the Lord had instructed. At times, of course, this would all seem a li'l confusing when society was expecting me to behave in a way that conflicted with my heart. But even back then, I didn't pay society any more mind than I do now.</p><p>'Round my sixth birthday we moved <i>uptown</i> -- actually eight blocks away -- to our new house, which wasn't any bigger, just more <i>modern</i>, 'cause it had an indoor toilet and it sat on a concrete foundation. We had a screened-in porch that y'walked up three steps to, and these led to the front door. The first thing that caught my eye was the curved design of those stairs -- and how good I'd look <i>posing</i> on them. I think you'd call this place a "raised ranch." I called it clean and <i>white</i>. Gleaming white. And it made me think we was going places, though we almost never left the territory that marked our black neighborhood. In fact, my childhood world was so tiny that not till junior high did I ever have a reason to cross Highway 90. Our new house was destiny enough for The Doll.</p><p>At home, Gran'mama preferred her entertainment from a radio whose tuner was perm'nently glued to the gospel station. Her evening domain was an overstuffed chair in a marigold plaid that belonged to her alone. She sat there quietly with her companion cup of coffee and other faithful forms of recreation: the daily newspaper and her Bible. My bedtime was nine o'clock on most nights, maybe later on a weekend, but only if we had a house full of folks over to play pinochle. Besides, I usually needed my beauty rest if I was gonna rise with the sun and be out the door exploring the wild grasses round Gran'mama's house.</p><p>Nature was my best friend, see, and my sense of amusement and curiosity -- well before I ever knew what <i>candy</i> was -- mostly came from the li'l creek behind our house that transported me to other worlds within my 'magination. I relished the ritual that became my daily communication with what I <i>perceived</i> was the rest of the planet. Every day I'd take all the nearby leaves that several ancient oaks had showered from their branches and write my name on them or maybe my initials and our address, then, one by one, I'd stagger this scribbled parade as I sent 'em off downstream.</p><p>"I wonder if they made it," I'd always sweetly wonder. Then I'd sit back and dream they were en route to Paris or Africa or whatever country we was studying that week at Stevens Elementary SchooI. I just knew they had to have gone farther than 717 Seventh Street, but where exactly was anybody's guess. I even waited in vain for the courtesy of a reply, though I s'ppose I got some satisfaction thinking that folks all over the world knew just where to find me in Quincy.</p><p>Sometimes I'd take to varying my li'l routine with an empty matchbox that I'd inscribe with an anonymous "I love you." While nowadays The Doll can still be found practicing this li'l gesture with gorgeous strangers in nightclubs coast-to-coast, back then she was pressing to find something more than just an amusement. But as much as I loved Gran'mama, I also needed a male role model in my life, and I became more conscious of this when we moved to that new house. <i>Where are the men?</i> I musta thought, knowing that something was always different about the Ponder household, which was only filled with women.</p><p>In the company of a man, I'd be jumping up and down, swishing about, and flirting up a storm. Well, girl, I can tell y'nothing's changed, but maybe back then I was just hoping any one of those men might stay for good. There was something different 'bout the way a man smelled and the way he canvassed a room with the strength of his body, waving <i>Good evenin", y'all</i> and muscling his way onto our corduroy sofa while any one of my three maiden aunts might be taking her sweet-ass time getting fixed up to party.</p><p>"Ever since y'was three years old, you be wantin' to sit up in men's laps!" Aunt Katie Bell still kids me. I useta think it mighta been just an early sexual attraction, but I only vaguely felt my <i>sexual</i> yearnings at that time. Though I do remember asking this one li'l neighborhood boy, who was prob'ly my same age of seven, to come out back with me one day so I could show him the li'l creek that was my stream of dreams. I told him the best way to look downriver was to lay on his stomach and rock back 'n' forth. Only in order to get a <i>real</i> view of the way the stream did its twist and turn, he needed to prop himself on something else to get a steadier motion. Yes, child, y'mama provided that rhythm!</p><p>"Edward? Y'come in here and help me get this bird plucked!" cried Gran'mama, who always called me by my middle name. She musta been peering through the kitchen window right then to check on us, just in case we'd drowned or something. But I knew it was really 'cause she meant to put a stop to the only sex I was ever gonna get as a child.</p><p>"Y'know, Edward, you'll have a family of y'own someday," she'd often impart, just before it led to a gentle request that I find something boyish to occupy my time with -- that, say, chopping the head off a chicken was fine enough, but cooking it was something else entirely; that it was okay to help her moisturize her dry scalp, just so long as I didn't get fixed on <i>styling</i> her hair, too. These were the sweet and subtle reminders that it was all right to be helpful, just not too domestic, that I'd one day have to assume the responsibilities of manhood. And, well, boyhood, in Gran'mama's eyes, seemed a fine enough place to start.</p><p>I can't tell y'very much about my daddy at all, 'cept that he was handsome and tall and that his name was Benjamin Franklin Knox. It occurs to me that I might be descended from one of them slaves of the real Benjamin Franklin, 'cause we all know The Doll's sure got a way with <i>electricity</i>. They called my daddy Frank, which is the name I used as my own in John Berendt's book. I fibbed a li'l, but now I'm coming clean.</p><p>My daddy came into my life on a visit once to Quincy when I was almost twelve. The first time I saw him was brief and <i>awkward</i>: I didn't know who he was outside of the fact that we were related, so I musta resented having to call him <i>Daddy</i>. Instead, I called him <i>sir</i>. The first thing I noticed 'bout him was his thick salt-'n'-pepper mustache and the smell of Old Spice all over his clothing. I never had any affection for him. Didn't want no hugs or kisses, no kinda promises of love or starting over. Too li'l, too late as far as his daughter with candy was concerned. He'd been missing for too damn long.</p><p>After that initial visit, the next thing I knew I was being sent to live with him in New York for the summer. F'sure he didn't like my girlie ways none -- not that we ever talked about it directly, but y'could tell he hated it about me.</p><p>"Whatcha mean y'don't <i>like</i> baseball?" My daddy demanded to know after I frowned at going to a Yankee game my second night there. "That ain't <i>normal</i> for a li'l boy y'age!"!"</p><p>"I don't know nothin' 'bout baseball, sir. Don't care to, neither, I pouted, my hips leading an aboutface in a sway of disgust.</p><p>He lived in New York City at Broadway and 125th Street, which was Harlem. Yeah, I may've been a sissy-hick from Florida, but I could tell from the get-go that this area was nothing but a shithole.</p><p>That summer of 1969, it was just the two of us and his girlfriend, a Latin bombshell named Lila, in his cramped one-bedroom apartment that was filled with worn-out and mismatched furniture.

Gomes invites us to hear anew the radical nature of Jesus' message of hope and change. Using examples from ancient times as well as from modern pop culture, <em>The Scandalous Gospel of Jesus</em> shows us why the good news is every bit as relevant today as when it was first preached.</p></p><p><p>Peter J. Gomes has been minister of Harvard University's Memorial Church since 1974, when he was appointed Pusey Minister of the church, and serves as Plummer Professor of Christian Morals. An American Baptist minister, he was named one of America's top preachers by <em>Time</em> magazine. He is the recipient of thirty-three honorary degrees and an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College, the University of Cambridge, England, where the Gomes Lectureship is established in his name.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> As minister of Harvard University's Memorial Church, Gomes was a popular preacher well before <i>The Good Book</i> became a bestseller in 1996. Several subsequent books were, or read like, first-rate sermon collections, but this is an incisive original aimed at cautious defenders of conventional wisdom. Asserting that we are meant to go beyond the Bible in order to discover the gospel, Gomes points away from the past toward a future in which promise and fulfillment meet. Meanwhile, we must manage to live in the world as it is&#x2014;a world steeped in hostility, suffering and injustice. If we take the gospel seriously, then like Jesus we will risk all, and might even lose all. Still, we hang on to a muscular hope that is not mere nostalgia for what never was, but an earnest expectation of what is to be. A born storyteller, Gomes knows how to spin an aphorism: The opposite of fear is not courage but compassion. And indeed his tone is compassionate even when he chides those who fear conflict and change, but especially when he extols God's provision for the healing and care of all his creation, and not simply our little part of it. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mark Lewis traces the changes that both underlay and resulted from this split in a period that saw the geographic redefinition of China, more engagement with the outside world, significant changes to family life, developments in the literary and social arenas, and the introduction of new religions.</p><p>The Yangzi River valley arose as the rice-producing center of the country. Literature moved beyond the court and capital to depict local culture, and newly emerging social spaces included the garden, temple, salon, and country villa. The growth of self-defined genteel families expanded the notion of the elite, moving it away from the traditional great Han families identified mostly by material wealth. Trailing the rebel movements that toppled the Han, the new faiths of Daoism and Buddhism altered every aspect of life, including the state, kinship structures, and the economy.</p><p>By the time China was reunited by the Sui dynasty in 589 ce, the elite had been drawn into the state order, and imperial power had assumed a more transcendent nature. The Chinese were incorporated into a new world system in which they exchanged goods and ideas with states that shared a common Buddhist religion. The centuries between the Han and the Tang thus had a profound and permanent impact on the Chinese world.</p></p><p><p>Mark Edward Lewis is Kwoh-Ting Li Professor in Chinese Culture at Stanford University.</p><p>Timothy Brook is Professor of History and Republic of China Chair at the University of British Columbia.</p>&#x201c;An original, useful, and very timely book, <i>China between Empires</i> is arguably the first single-volume comprehensive treatment for general readers of Chinese history between AD 220 and 589.

In this far-reaching but compact history, Roger Biles provides a much-needed, up-to-date account of the state�s development, from the early native settlements to the present. Focusing on Illinois�s demographic changes over time, he highlights the key figures who contributed to the state�s government, economy, culture, and the arts. <br> <br>While devoting attention to the touchstones of history, Illinois illuminates also the achievements of ordinary people, including the women, the African Americans, and the other minorities who&#x2014;along with the politicians, the captains of industry, and the military heroes&#x2014;contributed to the state�s growth and prosperity. National events shaped the state as well, and Biles explores the impact of such crises as the Civil War and World War II on the people of Illinois. <br> <br>No history of Illinois can ignore the state�s largest city, the dynamic metropolis on Lake Michigan&#x2014;Chicago. Drawing on extensive research, Biles illuminates Chicago�s past&#x2014;its outbursts of labor unrest and racial tensions as well as the splendors of two world�s fairs and an artistic renaissance&#x2014;while at the same time relating Chicago to the larger story of Illinois and its people. <br> <br>Connecting lesser-known stories with the main events of the state�s past, Biles writes in an accessible style that is at once entertaining and enlightening.

As early as the late seventeenth century, they were heavily featured in literature, art, theater, and even comedy, from the <em>Tale of the</em> <em>Heike</em> to the kabuki retellings of the 47 Ronin. This legacy remains with us today in the legendary Akira Kurosawa films, the shoguns of HBO's <em>Westworld</em>, and countless renditions of samurai history in anime, manga, and video games. Acknowledging these common depictions, this book gives readers access to the real samurai as they lived, fought, and served.<br><br>Much as they capture the modern imagination, the samurai commanded influence over the politics, arts, philosophy and religion of their own time, and ultimately controlled Japan from the fourteenth century until their demise in the mid-nineteenth century. On and off the battlefield, whether charging an enemy on horseback or currying favor at the imperial court, their story is one of adventures and intrigues, heroics and misdeeds, unlikely victories and devastating defeats. This book traces the samurai throughout this history, exploring their roles in watershed events such as Japan's invasions of Korea at the close of the sixteenth century and the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. Coming alive in these accounts are the samurai, both famed and ordinary, who shaped Japanese history.<br></p><p><ul><li>"Mike Wert has presented us with a wonderful overview of samurai in history, from ancient times to their modern reinvention.

It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded <i>Mastering Oracle SQL</i> has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.<i>Mastering Oracle SQL</i>, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL.

So argues Elizabeth R. Varon in <em>Armies of Deliverance</em>, a sweeping narrative of the Civil War and a bold new interpretation of Union and Confederate war aims. Northerners imagined the war as a crusade to deliver the Southern masses from slaveholder domination and to bring democracy, prosperity, and education to the region. As the war escalated, Lincoln and his allies built the case that emancipation would secure military victory and benefit the North and South alike. The theme of deliverance was essential in mobilizing a Unionist coalition of Northerners and anti Confederate Southerners.<br> <br>Confederates, fighting to establish an independent slaveholding republic, were determined to preempt, discredit, and silence Yankee appeals to the Southern masses. In their quest for political unity Confederates relentlessly played up two themes: Northern barbarity and Southern victimization. Casting the Union army as ruthless conquerors, Confederates argued that the emancipation of blacks was synonymous with the subjugation of the white South. <br> <br>Interweaving military and social history, Varon shows that everyday acts on the ground from the flight of slaves, to protests against the draft, the plundering of civilian homes, and civilian defiance of military occupation reverberated at the highest levels of government. Varon also offers new perspectives on major battles, illuminating how soldiers and civilians alike coped with the physical and emotional toll of the war as it grew into a massive humanitarian crisis. <br> <br>The Union's politics of deliverance helped it to win the war. But such appeals failed to convince Confederates to accept peace on the victor's terms, ultimately sowing the seeds of postwar discord. <em>Armies of Deliverance</em> offers innovative insights on the conflict for those steeped in Civil War history and novices alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elizabeth R. Varon</strong> is Langbourne M. Williams Professor of American History at the University of Virginia. She is the author of numerous award-winning books, including <em>Southern Lady, Yankee Spy: The True Story of Elizabeth Van Lew, A Union Agent in the Heart of the Confederacy </em>(OUP, 2003), <em>Disunion!: The Coming of the American Civil War, 1789-1859</em>, and <em>Appomattox: Victory, Defeat and Freedom at the End of the Civil War </em>(OUP, 2013).<br><br>"Elizabeth Varon has served up a fresh and convincing interpretation of Northern policy and goals in the Civil War. She portrays how an initial purpose to deliver the presumed legions of white Unionists in the South from suppression by Confederate domination evolved into a crusade to liberate whites and blacks alike from the iron grip of the slave power and slavery. This book offers a new perspective on the searing conflict of 1861-1865 that continues to provoke controversy today." - James M. McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em><p></p><br>"Drawing on her mastery of the Civil War era, Elizabeth Varon delivers a sweeping and bold synthesis that seamlessly blends the military, political, cultural, racial, and religious currents of the tragic conflict. Her deft use of 'deliverance' as a motif for understanding the wartime motivations of both nations provides an astute perspective on this endlessly fascinating period in United States history." -- Joan Waugh, co-author of <em>The American War: A History of the Civil War Era</em><p></p><br>"After reading about that conflict [the Civil War], I've had another surprise: Despite everything that has been written about it, there is always something new and interesting to say about the war and what it means. This thought was inspired by <em>Armies of Deliverance</em>. This impressive work is explicitly a political study of the war rather than a military one. As such, it makes a good companion volume to James McPherson's classic <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>."--Thomas Ricks, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"In this sweeping, comprehensive, and informed analysis of the Civil War and Reconstruction, Varon suggests new ways of interpreting old issues and questions. Northerners, she tells us, came to see the war in almost biblical terms; delivering white Southerners from an ill-fated course of secession and slaves from bondage. In white Southerners' rejection of these lofty Northern objectives is to be found the failure of Reconstruction." -- Richard Blackett, author of <em>The Captive's Quest for Freedom: Fugitive Slaves, the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law and the Politics of Slavery</em> <br><p></p><br>"Witnessing intense debates over the meaning of Confederate monuments, many twenty-first-century Americans assume that Lost Cause southerners have long had the upper hand in the battle over Civil War memory. In her well-crafted and perceptive narrative, Elizabeth Varon offers a necessary corrective to that view. It was the rhetoric of deliverance, she contends, that not only won the hearts and minds of Union soldiers and shaped Lincoln's policies, but also, in the end, made military victory possible."-- Nancy Isenberg, author of <em>White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America</em><p></p><br>"A fresh interpretation of the Civil War that illuminates why Americans took up arms against each other. An accessible work of scholarship that will be of great interest to students of Civil War history." - <em>Kirkus Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br>"Elizabeth R. Varon's highly original and sweeping new study, <em>Armies of Deliverance</em>, [is] one of the few histories of the war since James M. McPherson's <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em> (1988) that deserve to be ranked as essential reading. Had Ms. Varon devoted a smaller book to her case, she would undoubtedly have produced a valuable academic resource. But she has bravely aimed for something bigger, not only inviting us to reconsider the motivation but providing a thorough, highly readable history of the war itself." -- <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Armies of Deliverance</em> offers a fresh, innovative, and quite readable account of the American Civil War. By recasting the conflict as a 'war of liberation,' Varon presents new insights along with revealing evidence (especially from more moderate voices) that make this an important book for historians as well as a most enlightening one for general readers. Students and veteran scholars alike will learn a great deal from this fine book." -- George C. Rable, author of <em>Damn Yankees! Demonization and Defiance in the Confederate South</em><p></p><br>"Thought-provoking Varon paints a portrait of the Civil War-era South that is counterintuitive; it's not a traditional story of North versus South but rather a story of North and South versus the Confederacy. Varon creates thrilling set pieces of all the familiar battles and controversies, and she does a particularly shrewd and sensitive job of parsing the significance of both the Emancipation Proclamation and the 1864 election."-Steven Donoghue, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"Everyone knows that Confederates fought the Civil War to preserve and extend the slave system that produced their wealth and shaped their society. But what, exactly, did white Northerners fight for? In her often-riveting <em>Armies of Deliverance</em>, Elizabeth R. Varon answers that question in a new way, with important ramifications for how we understand the nation's most significant conflict, the meaning of anti-slavery politics and the disappointments of postwar Reconstruction. Varon...narrates battles and campaigns with an unusually deft, at times even gorgeous touch. This is some of the finest battle writing around, and a sweeping analysis of both United States and Confederate strategy and tactics."- Gregory Downs, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"An outstanding book-one of the best accounts of the Civil War we have.Varon is determined to tell as much of the story as possible through the voices of the men and women who experienced it. No other general history of the war so lavishly quotes from the letters of soldiers, the diaries of women, the self-serving excuses of incompetent generals, the editorials of partisans, the denunciations of critics, and the speeches of politicians. The highest ideals held by the combatants come through as clearly as the most repellent outbursts of racist demagoguery. Through these voices, readers can get a feeling for the ground-level, tactile experience of the war as well as the dramatic debates in the halls of Congress. The myriad horrors of battle are vividly rendered, and so is the 1864 presidential election." --James Oakes, <em>The Nation</em> <br><p></p><br>""<em>Armies of Deliverance</em> is, in one respect, not actually a "new history of the Civil War" so much as it is a new interpretation of the Civil War. And in that departure, Varon succeeds grandlyEL.I would argueELthatELgetting the Civil War narrative into the workable space Varon has achieved means that some highly prized clutter simply has to go, and I do not think she has made her cast-asides unwisely. This is, after all, a history wrapped around a single theme-deliverance of the mass of the Southern people from oligarchy - from which too many other Civil War stories would only serve as distractions."-Allen Guelzo, Law and Liberty blog<p></p><br></p><h2>Galatea (Revels Student Editions)</h2><p>Devised as an entertainment for a Tudor monarch, Galatea might be seen, paradoxically, as a parable for our time. Inhabiting a world engaged in a process of change, the characters find themselves locked in a series of transgressive situations that speak directly to contemporary experience and twenty-first-century critical concerns. Same-sex relationships, shifts of authority, and the destabilization of meaning all lend the play a surprising modernity, making it at once the most accessible of Lyly&#x2019;s plays and the one most frequently performed today. <br><br>Designed for the student reader, Leah Scragg&#x2019;s edition offers a range of perspectives on the work. An extensive introduction locates the play in the context of the Elizabethan court, opening a window onto a kind of drama very different from that of more familiar sixteenth-century writers, such as Marlowe and Shakespeare. The latter&#x2019;s indebtedness to the play is fully documented, while detailed critical and performance histories allow an insight into the work&#x2019;s susceptibility to reinterpretation.</p><p>Leah Scragg is an Honoarary Senior Research Fellow in the School of Arts, Histories and Cultures at the University of ManchesterThe play is admirably edited for Revels Student Editions by Leah Scragg.

Her shrewd annotation, and her generous introduction that opens all the wavelengths that the play touches on, with fair-minded accounts of the stage history and of previous criticism, provide a lavish, indeed royal portal to an exquisite courtly comedy.&#39; Peter Saccio, Around the Globe, issue 54 (summer 2013)</p><h2>Mathematics for Elementary Teachers with Activities</h2><p><p> </p> <p>NOTE: This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Truly unforgettable." <br>-<i>BookPage</i> </b><p>In 1862, the men of Water's Ford, Pennsylvania, rally to President Lincoln's call while Dorothea Granger marshals her friends to "wield their needles for the Union." Meanwhile, Anneke Bergstrom hides the shame she feels for her husband's pacifism; gifted writer Gerda Bergstrom takes on local Southern sympathizers in the pages of the <i>Water's Ford Register</i>; and Constance Wright struggles to help her husband gain entry to the Union Army-despite the color of his skin. As the women work, hope, and pray, the men they love confront loneliness, boredom, and danger on the battlefield. But the women of the sewing circle also forge a new independence that will forever alter the patchwork of life in the Elm Creek Valley.</p></p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini lives with her husband and two sons in Madison, Wisconsin. In addition to the six volumes in the Elm Creek Quilts series and two books of quilt patterns inspired by the novels, she designs the Elm Creek Quilts fabric line from Red Rooster Fabrics. Her most recent book is <i>Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker.</i>In her true-to-form latest, Chiaverini (The Aloha Quilt; etc.) goes back to the Civil War era as the men go off to fight and the women of Elm Creek Valley support the Union troops. While the women struggle with their own problems, updates from the front amplify tensions as the war comes closer to home, leading some to tragedy and others to heartbreaking revelations. Among the many developments, Dorothea sends husband Thomas off to war with her favorite quilt; Constance's husband, Abel, seeks a way to serve a Union that won't enlist him because he's black; Gerda pines for Jonathan, who brings his medical skills to the front; and Gerda's brother, Hans, refuses to fight because he is a pacifist. Chiaverini does a good job balancing the experiences of the women at home and the men on the front, though, oddly, the quilting is all but absent. There's enough exposition to welcome new readers without bogging down the tale, resulting in a reliably heartwarming and accessible story. (Feb.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Look. At. That.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what Charlie did when he wanted to make sure you got his point, turned words into sentences, full stop.<br><br>Some. Sweet. Deal.<br><br>Big. Brass. Balls.<br><br>The first night they&#x2019;d met, almost twenty-five years ago, in that crowded bar in the Village that was a vegan restaurant now: You. Are. Great.<br><br>Really. Really. Great.<br><br>Nora could not recall exactly when she&#x2019;d first begun to think, if not to say: Just. So. Annoying.<br><br>In the line of narrow townhouses that made up their side of the block, standing shoulder to shoulder like slender soldiers of flawless posture and unvarying appearance, there was one conspicuous break, a man down, a house-width opening to a stretch of macadam turned into an outdoor parking lot. It held only six cars, and since nearly everyone on the block wanted a space, it had become a hot commodity, a peculiar status symbol.<br><br>A book about the city&#x2019;s history, in the archives of a museum at which she had once interviewed for a job, had told Nora that a house in that space had been gutted in a fire, and the family that owned it had never bothered to rebuild. It had happened in the early 1930s, when the country, the city, and the west side of Manhattan had no money, which of course had happened again in the 1970s, and would doubtless happen again sometime in the future, because that was how the world worked.<br><br>At the moment, however, it seemed scarcely possible. A house on the next block had just sold for $10 million in a bidding war. The couple who sold it had bought it for $600,000 when their children were young. Nora knew this because she and her neighbors talked about real estate incessantly. Their children, their dogs, and housing prices: the holy trinity of conversation for New Yorkers of a certain sort. For the men, there were also golf courses and wine lists to be discussed; for the women, dermatologists. Remembering the playground conversations when her children were small, Nora realized that the name of the very best pediatrician had given way to the name of the very best plastic surgeon.<br><br>A single block in the middle of what seemed like the most populous island on earth&#x2014;although it was not, a professor of geography had once told Nora; it was not even in the top ten&#x2014;and it was like a small town. The people who owned houses on the block had watched one another&#x2019;s children grow up, seen one another&#x2019;s dogs go from puppy to infirmity to the crematorium at Hartsdale Pet Cemetery. They knew who redecorated when, and who couldn&#x2019;t afford to. They all used the same handyman.<br><br>&#x201c;You live on that dead-end block?&#x201d; someone had asked Nora at an art opening several years before. &#x201c;One of my friends rented a place there for a year. He said it was like a cult.&#x201d;<br><br>None of those who owned on the block cared about the renters. They came and they went, with their sofa beds and midcentury-modern knockoffs, their Ikea boxes at the curb. They were young, unmoored. They didn&#x2019;t hang Christmas wreaths or plant window boxes.<br><br>The owners all did, and they stuck.<br><br>From time to time a real estate agent would troll the block, pushing his card through mail slots and scribbling notes about that odd empty parcel on the north side, to see who owned it and whether a new townhouse could be built there. For now it was a narrow, ill-kept parking lot, oddly shaped, like one of those geometry problems designed to foil students on the SATs: determine the area of this rhomboid. In the worst of the parking spaces, the one wedged into a cut-in behind the back of the neighboring house, Charlie Nolan&#x2019;s Volvo wagon, in a color called Sherwood Green, now sat. It had been there only for five hours, by Nora&#x2019;s reckoning, and already the windshield was pocked with the chalky white confetti of pigeon droppings.<br><br>That morning, just after sunrise, Charlie had flipped on the overhead light in their bedroom, his face lit up the way it was when he was part of a big deal, had underestimated his bonus, or paid less for a bottle of wine than he decided it was worth.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a space!&#x201d; he crowed.<br><br>Nora heaved herself up onto her elbows. &#x201c;Have you lost your mind?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry sorry sorry,&#x201d; Charlie said, turning the light off but not moving from the doorway. There was a marital rule of long standing: Nora was to be allowed to sleep as long as she liked on weekends unless there was an emergency. She thought of herself as a person who had few basic requirements, but sleep was one of them. The six months during which her children had wanted to be fed, or were at least awake, in the middle of the night were among the most difficult months of her life. If she had not given birth to twins she might have had only one child, the sleep deprivation was so terrible.<br><br>Charlie knew this. He got up and went to work earlier than Nora, and the top of his dresser, the bathroom, his closet were all equipped with small flashlights by which he would dress, and dress again after he had taken the dog to the dog run, come home, and showered. Usually by the time he was in a suit and tie and eating his All-Bran, Nora was at the kitchen table in her nightgown, although it was her preference that they talk as little as possible in the morning.<br><br>Yet here was her husband, waking her on a Saturday, with the light full in her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a space,&#x201d; he said again, but less maniacally, as though he was setting his emotional temperature closer to hers.<br><br>And now she could see their car in the space, already moved from the enclosed garage two blocks away to the dogleg in the lot. Charlie was humming to himself. When they had first moved to the block, Charlie asked around among the other parkers to see if he could inherit the space vacated by the people they were buying the house from. It was communicated in no uncertain terms, and in that osmotic way in which things became known on the block, that a space in the lot was a privilege, not a right, and Charlie somewhat truculently signed up for the indoor garage nearby, privately adding the failure to his list of Things That Were Not Going the Way They Should for Charlie Nolan, a list that in the last year Nora suspected had become a book, perhaps even an encyclopedia.<br><br>While Charlie often complained to Nora that the fee for the enclosed garage was only slightly less than the rent on their first apartment, there had never even been a question of parking on the street. Paying for parking relieved one of those petty aggravations that was like dripping water on the stone of self, until one day you discovered it had left a hole the size of a fist in your head. Nora knew that for Charlie, living in the city meant more drips, with harder water. He reminded her of it often enough. New York was not Charlie&#x2019;s natural habitat.<br><br>Nora hoped that this morning&#x2019;s triumph, small but seemingly monumental to her husband, would make up for that in some fashion. It had rankled for years, when Charlie passed the opening to the lot, and now he had finally scored a space. On the dining room table lay the typed notice, slipped through their mail slot, informing Charlie that the spot formerly allotted to the Dicksons was his if he wanted it; in the spot now was their Volvo. It was a car like their life, prosperous, understated, orderly&#x2014;no food wrappers, no baby seats, no coins or crumbs on the floor. When the lease on the car was up it would barely need to be detailed before they got another just like it. Charlie always wondered aloud about other manufacturers, models, colors. Nora didn&#x2019;t care. She was scarcely ever in the car.<br><br>A white plastic bag eddied around Nora&#x2019;s bare ankles for a moment in a breathless summer breeze, touching her, tickling her, circling her painted pink toes. She kicked it aside and it moved down the block, rising and falling like a tiny ghost, disappearing between two parked cars. The street smelled like dank river low tide, melting tar, and, as always in warm weather, the vinegar tang of garbage. Nora had had to yank their dog away from a cardboard container of moo shu something, pulled from a hole in a bag by some other dog and upended near the dead end.<br><br>It was crazy, but there was a small, secret part of Nora that was comfortable with trash on the street. It reminded her of her youth, when she&#x2019;d first arrived in a nastier, scarier, dirtier New York City and moved into a shabby apartment with her best friend, Jenny. A better New York, she sometimes thought to herself now, but never, ever said, one of the many things none of them ever admitted to themselves, at least aloud: that it was better when it was worse.<br><br>Homer teased the air at the entrance to the lot with his muzzle and then sat. Their dog knew their block, their house, even their car, and he tolerated riding in it, wedging himself into the foot well alongside Oliver&#x2019;s enormous sneakers. Rachel complained that Homer was not as affectionate with her as he was with her brother, which Nora thought was probably true. But ten minutes of Homer on Rachel&#x2019;s insteps and she would be whining that her feet had fallen asleep and there was no reason their dog couldn&#x2019;t ride in the way back like other dogs. Nora worried that her daughter had difficulty discerning the difference between what she really wanted and what other people made seem desirable. Now that Rachel was out of her teens and in college, Nora hoped she was outgrowing this, although in New York it made her merely typical.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; Charlie had said when Nora mentioned it to him. Which had become a bit of a theme in their house on every subject.<br><br>&#x201c;Listening to you people,&#x201d; said Jenny, the only one in their women&#x2019;s lunch group who had never been married, &#x201c;marriage sounds sort of like the den. It&#x2019;s a good place to chill out, but it&#x2019;s not the most important room in the house. Which makes me wonder why you&#x2019;re all so anxious for me to have one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think the den is the most important room in the house,&#x201d; Suzanne, who was a decorator, replied.<br><br>&#x201c;The kitchen is the most important room in the house,&#x201d; Elena said.<br><br>&#x201c;If you cook,&#x201d; Suzanne replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Who still cooks?&#x201d; said Jean-Ann.<br><br>Jenny turned to Nora. &#x201c;Did everyone miss the entire point of what I said?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Nora said.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Nora had said when Charlie asked if she wanted to walk down the block to the lot once he&#x2019;d moved the car in, knowing that staying at the breakfast table to finish her bagel and read the newspapers was not conducive to a day of amity. But she balked at going any farther into the lot than that. &#x201c;Come take a look,&#x201d; Charlie said now, as though the lot contained infinite vistas, gardens, and statuary instead of just three brick walls, several other cars, a center drain, and two of those squat, black plastic boxes that were everywhere in the parks and backyards of New York City, sheltering blocks of flavored rat poison from passing dogs.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going back there,&#x201d; Nora said. &#x201c;Charity says that&#x2019;s where all the rats live.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So are the subway tracks, and you take the subway.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t take it much. Nora liked to walk, and when she did take the train she made certain not to look down at the tracks. She&#x2019;d tried to analyze the depth of her rat phobia, but she&#x2019;d given it up as pointless. Why were squirrels fine, anodyne, and rats insupportable, provoking a chemical reaction so profound that her breathing didn&#x2019;t return to normal for minutes at a time? Everyone had something; when they were growing up her sister had wakened her at least a dozen times because there was a spider in her room. Charlie hated snakes. <br><br>&#x201c;Everybody hates snakes,&#x201d; Rachel had said, dismissive even as a small child. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Nora had replied.<br><br>And why had she chosen what seemed to be the rat capital of the world in which to make a life? She remembered her friend Becky from college, who was terrified of water&#x2014;no need for deep analysis; her younger brother had nearly drowned on the Vineyard when they were children, pulled from the surf and given CPR by a lifeguard. Still, Becky had gotten a job managing a spa with an enormous saltwater pool. She&#x2019;d insisted she didn&#x2019;t mind, but as soon as she could she&#x2019;d moved on to a sprawling country inn. There was a river at the bottom of the hill on which the inn sat, but she was never required to go near it. Nora understood that, unlike Becky&#x2019;s phobia, most of these aversions were chemical and intuitive, the way some people immediately fell in love with New York, and other people said that they could never live there. (&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; Nora had said once to her sister, Christine, on the phone. &#x201c;If I went to Greenwich and said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t understand how anyone can stand to live here,&#x2019; people would think I was rude.&#x201d;)<br><br>Charlie walked to the back of the parking lot and out again, as though he were surveying his property. It wasn&#x2019;t a long walk. &#x201c;No rats,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Just because you can&#x2019;t see them doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;re not there,&#x201d; said Nora.<br><br>Halfway down the block one of the guys who worked for Ricky taking care of their houses was hosing down the sidewalk. Ricky&#x2019;s guys tended to be small, dark, and stocky, former residents of some Central American country who were willing to do almost any kind of work to earn money. This one had just washed out all their garbage cans, but the effort was fruitless. The greasy sheen on both the pavement and in the cans would reassert itself, summer&#x2019;s urban perspiration. It was one of the reasons people who could afford to do so fled New York, for Nantucket, the Hamptons, somewhere cleaner, greener. Somewhere more boring, Nora often thought to herself.</p><h2>Real Men Do Yoga: 21 Star Athletes Reveal Their Secrets for Strength, Flexibility and Peak Performance</h2><p>With its revolutionary approach to yoga and innovative, male-oriented instruction, <i>Real Men Do Yoga </i>will be the definitive guide for both novice and veteran men who are discovering the innumerable physical and mental benefits of yoga.<br><br>Satisfying the male fascination with sports and admiration for athletes are interviews with more than twenty pros, all of whom are enthusiastic yoga practitioners: football's Eddie George, Shannon Sharpe and Amani Toomer; baseball pitchers Barry Zito (2002 Cy Young Award winner) and Al Leiter, star hockey goalie Sean Burke and NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as well as pro golfers and tennis players. <br><br>Photos of sports stars doing yoga, such as football greats Dan Marino and Chris Carter, drive home a powerful message.

From the Introduction: People who think they &#34;would like to have a little farm&#34; naturally fall into two groups; those who are sure to fail and those likely to succeed. This book is written to help both! Its presentation of advantages and disadvantages, essential farming principles and practices should enable you to decide in which class you belong and whether or not you would be foolish or wise to risk making the plunge. In either case it should be worth many times its price because, on the one hand it should prevent foredoomed failure, and on the other, show you how to avoid delay, disappointment, perhaps disaster, but attain the satisfaction that characterizes personal and well directed efforts in farming. No matter in which of the groups mentioned you place yourself, it is natural that you should ask whether I am a practical man or merely a professor or a writer! Though I must confess to having held professorial and editorial positions, these were because of my familiarity with practical matters. My experience began before my earliest &#34;little red schoolhouse&#34; days and, barring interruptions, has continued until the present. At various times I worked on five farms, on one or another of which the leading features were dairy cattle, sheep, grain, hay, fruit, vegetables and bees. As the owners of these places were good farmers and communicative I learned much from them in addition to how to handle tools and implements effectively.

Inside you will find: </p> <ul> <li>Simple practices to avoid needlessly complicating meditation</li> <li>Where most of us get stuck in meditation&#x2014;and how to get unstuck</li> <li>A unique focus on meditation not simply as a spiritual technique, but as a way of living</li> </ul></p><p><p>Steve Hagen is a Zen priest, a longtime teacher of Buddhism, and the author of the bestselling <em>Buddhism Plain and Simple</em> and <em>Buddhism Is Not What You Think</em>. Hagen began studying Buddhism in 1967. In 1975 he became a student of Dainin Katagiri Roshi, and in 1979 he was ordained a Zen priest. Steve lives in Minneapolis, where he lectures, teaches meditation, and writes. He is currently head teacher at Dharma Field Meditation and Learning Center in Minneapolis.</p>Zen priest Hagen, author of <i>Buddhism Plain and Simple</i> and <i>Buddhism Is Not What You Think</i>, offers a brief and wonderfully accessible primer on meditation, which can be a surprisingly difficult practice for many beginners. He helpfully defines meditation via negativa: meditation is not a self-help program, a quick fix, a mind-training technique or a way to relax before jumping right back into the fray of our busy lives. It's a lifelong practice that can, and should, seep into every arena of the quotidian, so that when we're attentively folding laundry or taking out the trash, we're doing meditation. It involves teaching the mind just to be here, says Hagen. Three dozen microchapters are organized into sections on getting started, establishing a daily practice and doing meditation for the long run. While there are a few black-and-white illustrations to get readers to try seated meditation in different postures, Hagen emphasizes that it's also okay to sit in a chair (without slouching), stand, walk barefoot or even lie down. The key is to be constant, meditating at precisely the same time every day and allowing the mind to settle into the present. Meditation isn't something we apply to our life, Hagen insists. Rather, we take it up as our life. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This means riders are facing the challenge of mastering one of the world's most esteemed equestrian events on horses that may not be bred specifically for the task, or even if they have been, may not be top prospects for any number of reasons. International dressage judge, clinician, and riding coach Janet Foy has ridden many different horses&#x2014;different sizes, colors, and breeds&#x2014;to the highest levels of dressage competition, and now she has compiled her best tips for training and showing in one highly enjoyable book.

From the papyrus letters that Cicero and other Roman statesmen used to exchange news, to the hand-printed tracts of the Reformation and the pamphlets that spread propaganda during the American and French revolutions, the ways people shared information with their peers in the past are echoed in the present. </p><p>Standage reminds us how historical social networks have much in common with modern social media. The Catholic Church's dilemmas in responding to Martin Luther's attacks are similar to those of today's large institutions in responding to criticism on the Internet, for example, and seventeenth-century complaints about the distractions of coffeehouses mirror modern concerns about social media. Invoking figures from Thomas Paine to Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, Standage explores themes that have long been debated, from the tension between freedom of expression and censorship to social media's role in spurring innovation and fomenting revolution. <i>Writing on the Wall</i> draws on history to cast provocative new light on today's social media and encourages debate and discussion about how we'll communicate in the future.</p></p><p><b>Tom Standage</b> is digital editor at the<i> Economist</i> and editor in chief of Economist.com. He is the author of six books, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>A History of the World in 6 Glasses </i>and <i>The Victorian Internet</i>, described by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as a &#x201c;dot-com cult classic.&#x201d; Standage has written for numerous publications, including <i>Wired</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <i>Guardian</i>.

Standage (A History of the World in 6 Glasses, 2005) explores the human impulse to socialize and the earlier technologies, from papyrus to printing press, that accommodated that impulse. Messengers and travelers shuttled papyrus rolls throughout the Roman Empire. An early Roman newspaper, founded by Julius Caesar, no less, was posted, and readers were expected to copy it and distribute the news themselves through their social networks. The wax tablet bore strong resemblance to the iPad. Pamphlets and news ballads went viral, spread throughout Europe by travelers, and the Devonshire Manuscript was the Tudor-era Facebook. Standage compares the back-and-forth of ancient graffiti comments to comment threads in blogs and puts Paul&#x2019;s epistles in the context of social media as he and other apostles spread Christianity. Rumors, gossip, love poems, and political and religious unrest were all part of the stew of discussion as technology morphed into mass communication and the Internet age. Standage offers historical perspective on such concerns about evolving social media as faddishness, coarsening of discourse, distraction from serious work, and erosion of social skills. Still, the social media evolution marched on, influencing politics and religion and aiding revolution in Europe and the Americas. A thoroughly fascinating look at the evolution of social media. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Trapped!

Smarter not in the sense that our IQ score rises, but smarter in a much more important sense. This book is about the growth of human understanding, a kind of understanding that enables us to see both ourselves and others more clearly and, in the process, leads us to feel more deeply. Its focus is a remarkable new theory of the development of the self by Harvard psychologist Robert Kegan. The ideas contained in this book will enable you to view yourself, others, and the world through new eyes. It will put your experience of living in the world in motion and, I hope, make you both more discerning and thereby more vulnerable to our very human struggle of making sense of our lives.</p><p></p><h2>Elon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Highly recommended for high school and ambitious middle school readers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>School Library Journal</em></strong></p><p><strong>"A valuable addition to STEM-themed collections." <em>&#x2014;</em><em>VOYA</em></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>An in-depth look into the extraordinary life of the world&#x2019;s most important entrepreneur, Elon Musk</strong></p><p>This fascinating and easily accessible paperback young readers&#x2019; adaptation of Ashlee Vance&#x2019;s <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</em> features black-and-white photographs throughout and an epilogue. </p><p>The version for adults has been praised as &#x201c;riveting&#x201d; (<em>The Financial Times</em>), &#x201c;spirited&#x201d; (<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>), and &#x201c;masterful&#x201d; (Vice).

Forged antiquities. A country at war. A camel in the garden. A cameo by Lawrence of Arabia. Add in Peters&#x2019;s trademark intelligent plotting, engaging characters, and stylish writing and we can hardly ask for anything more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most beloved characters in mystery/suspense fiction, archeologist and Egyptologist Amelia Peabody bravely faces gravest peril in Cairo on the eve of World War One in <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters&#x2019;s magnificent Egyptian adventure, <i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky.</i> The <i>San Francisco Examiner </i>calls these heart-racing exploits of Amelia and her courageous family, the Emersons, &#x201c;pure delight.&#x201d; But perhaps the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> states it best: &#x201c;Between Amelia Peabody and Indiana Jones, it&#x2019;s Amelia&#x2014;in wit and daring&#x2014;by a landslide.&#x201d;</p></p><p><i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky</i> completes an internal quartet (which also includes <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i>, and <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i>) within Elizabeth Peters's legendary series starring Amelia Peabody, the intrepid Edwardian Egyptologist, her husband, Emerson, and her extended family. The quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious "Manuscript H," an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds of Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas. <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i> left readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud. <p> The winter of 1914-15 finds the Peabody-Emerson family back in Cairo--now under British martial law, with the Suez Canal under constant threat of attack from the Ottoman Empire. The city's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist, except for Ramses, who is widely scorned for his pacifism. Yet Amelia and Emerson soon find out that Ramses is (literally) playing a mysterious and potentially explosive part in the conflict between Egyptian nationalists and the British authorities, for reasons both political and familial. Nefret, for her part, is still running a health clinic for the city's fallen women and trying to avoid the attentions of Percy, Amelia's odious nephew. In the meantime, the Emersons' excavations at Giza reveal an unexpected treasure so remarkable that the uneasy Amelia immediately senses the fine hand of Sethos, the Master Criminal (who through many previous books has alternately plagued her and protested his boundless affection for her), at work. The climax and denouement are entirely worth the price of admission--tying up a decade's worth of loose strings and explaining some nagging points so subtle that less observant readers might easily have missed them. It's Peters's great gift that in the grand scheme of things, no clues are wasted. Her plotting is wonderfully complex and intriguing, and it fits seamlessly into the detailed historical background she builds so carefully. It may have taken years for her to complete this four-part dance (she promises more Amelia Peabody mysteries in the future), but she's charmed us right out of our dancing slippers along the way. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><p>Trouble is brewing in Egypt at the close of 1914 and no one will escape the coming tempest. With the world at war, Amelia Peabody and her husband Radcliffe Emerson have returned to Cairo for another season of archaeological excavation&#x2014;despite the increasing danger of an attack on the Suez Canal and on Egypt itself.</p><p>A terrible conflict looms.

Rare are the football innovations that have occurred without an owner, general manager, coach, or player up against the wall and reaching for a way to succeed anyway. In this meticulously researched, lively book, <i>Bleacher Report</i> lead NFL scout Doug Farrar traces the schematic history of the pro game through these &#x201c;if this/then that&#x201d; moments&#x2014;paradigm shifts in the game from 1920 through the present. More than just a book about schemes and strategies, <i>The Genius of Desperation: The Schematic Innovations that Made the Modern NFL </i>also tells the stories of the game&#x2019;s most prominent innovators, the adversities they endured, and the ways in which they learned to exceed their own expectations on the path to true greatness. Everyone from George Halas to Greasy Neale, Paul Brown to Sid Gillman, Bill Walsh to Chip Kelly is featured, as well as many more.</p><p><b>Doug Farrar </b>is a Seattle-based journalist who has written about football for <i>Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo! Sports, ESPN, Football Outsiders, The Washington Post</i>, and other outlets during the last 15 years. This is his first book.<br><br> After playing seven years in the NFL and spending more than a decade in NFL front offices,<b> Louis Riddick</b> works as an NFL analyst for <i>ESPN</i>. He resides in Bristol, Connecticut.&#x201c;As someone who knows Paul Zimmerman well, I can tell you Dr. Z would love this book. Doug Farrar has written about this great game like he was in the gameplan sessions with Bill Walsh and Joe Gibbs. Savor this book. It's a great contribution to the comprehension of a deep, deep game.&#x201d; &#x2014;Peter King, NBC Sports<br><br>&#x201c;The best book ever written about the NFL&#x2019;s on-field evolution. If you&#x2019;re a football geek, this book is for you. If you&#x2019;re a fan of good writing and journalism, this book is also for you.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mike Freeman,<i> Bleacher Report</i><br><br>"An exceptional deep dive into what makes football, football." &#x2014;Trey Wingo, ESPN<br><br>&#x201c;Comprehensive and compelling, thoughtful and thought-provoking, interesting and insightful.

I always look forward to reading Doug&#x2019;s work because of his dedication as well as the massive amount of research he conducts for all of his projects. His love for football and his proclivity for preparation have never been more evident than in <i>The Genius of Desperation</i>, in which Doug explains the design of many of the great innovations in football tactics, as well as who created them, and when, where, and why.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tony Khan, Jacksonville Jaguars&#x2019; senior vice president of football administration and technology<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s often said the NFL is a &#x201c;copycat&#x201d; league. If a play works for one team, another tries it. But someone came up with that play in the first place, and this fascinating account tracks key innovations back to their sources. Farrar, the lead scout for Bleacher Report, finds a similarity among the innovators they were all desperate for something new. We learn, for example, that the modern passing game owes its existence to Sid Gilman, a coach in the upstart American Football League, which was struggling to survive. Gilman developed &#x201c;timing&#x201d; pass patterns in which a quarterback would throw to a spot with the expectation the receiver and the ball would arrive simultaneously, That&#x2019;s the cornerstone of the modern NFL offense today. Defense changed forever with the arrival of New York Giant rookie linebacker Sam Huff in the late fifties. His talents were so special that the Giants needed a new scheme to showcase them; thus, the invention of the 4-3 defense, predicated on the physical and mental skills of the middle linebacker. An entertaining and deep dive into the evolution of the modern game.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Booklist</p><h2>The Chisellers (Agnes Browne Series)</h2><p>The <b>Mrs. Browne</b> trilogy became an instant bestselling success in author <b>Brendan O'Carroll</b>'s native Ireland. Similarly, when Plume introduced <b>The Mammy</b> (the first book in the series, May 1999) in the United States, it was greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm from American readers. Fans of Agnes Browne craving further hilarious and heartwarming adventures will be delighted with <b>The Chisellers</b>. Agnes, the lovable and determined heroine, returns with her seven children&#x2014;whom she affectionately calls "the chisellers"&#x2014;all struggling to make their way in the world with varying degrees of success. To make matters more difficult, as Agnes struggles along the bumpy road of parenting, she learns that the family is about to be forced out of their tenement home in the name of urban renewal. Pierre, Agnes' persistent suitor, is thankfully on hand to console her. Like all good Irish stories, <b>The Chisellers</b> includes a wedding and a funeral, much laughter and some tears&#x2014;and it is sure to please newcomers as well as loyal fans of this terrific series.</p><p>In his introduction to this second episode in the rollicking trilogy that began with <i>The Mammy</i> (1994), Brendan O'Carroll explains that his greatest surprise and pleasure, in the wake of his newfound literary success, was meeting people who told him it was the first book they had ever read. And it's easy to imagine how new readers would be drawn in by engaging, larger-than-life characters, colorful dialogue, and high-spirited plot. <i>The Chisellers</i> opens in 1970, with the widow Agnes Browne still struggling to raise her brood (the chisellers of the title) alone, although the broad-shouldered Mark is now an apprentice carpenter and Rory, his gay brother, is an apprentice hair stylist. Agnes may be too caught up in her exciting bingo win of 310 pounds to notice that little Dermot is developing a dangerous taste for shoplifting, but she frequently wrings her hands over Frankie, a neo-Nazi thug who has been expelled from school. <p> Into this flurry of daily concerns and excitements comes a letter from the local housing authority, notifying her that all the indigent families in her neighborhood are being relocated from their shabby but familiar tenements in the center of Dublin to new houses in a distant suburb. At the sad but raucous farewell party at the pub, Agnes sits drinking cider "in her usual corner," remembering her best friend, Marion, who died three years before: "Ah Jaysus, Marion, listen to them!" she muses. "The music of The Jarro! Will we ever hear the likes of it again?" </p><blockquote> The music to which Agnes referred could not be played on any instrument, but was the cackle of voices and rhythmic banter of the inner-city folk, the symphony of unanswered questions and impossible statements, that were so much of the colour of Dublin: "Hey, Mr. Foley. A vodka with ice--and fresh ice, none of that frozen stuff!" This would be followed by a howl of laughter. </blockquote> As you read, it is impossible not to envision a feel-good film of <i>The Chisellers</i> (Anjelica Huston directed <i>The Mammy</i>) and to admire O'Carroll's comic skill, even if his sunny, too-tidy conclusion to the novel makes Frank McCourt read like Dostoyevsky. <i>--Regina Marler</i>5 cds</p><h2>How To Do Psychic Readings Through Touch</h2><p><p>You've probably heard the expression, "If these walls could talk..."

I read all I could get and am waiting for more.</p><p>Ms. McKenna is a truly gifted writer, especially with her dialogue.</p><p>I hope the Forgotten Coast series continues for many, many novels. It's a heck of a world to get lost inside of, and I really love these characters. But if McKenna kills the rooster, I'll never forgive her.</p><p>Reminded me of HBO&#x2019;s True Detective with its slightly ominous depiction of southern life.</p><p>I must add my praise for this unexpectedly complex book, which I bought because it's set in a location I've loved for years and because I enjoy good mysteries. I'm surprised but very happy to report that McKenna gave me considerably more than I expected.</p><p>The dialogue is masterful and her description of Apalachicola is dead-on. You actually feel the humidity and hear the rustle of the palm trees. I was so drawn into the book that I read it in one sitting - I couldn't put it down.</p><p>Taking a chance on a new author and falling in love with their writing style is as cool as discovering a musical group you'll end up listening to for decades. That is how I felt when I discovered Dawn Lee McKenna's book, Low Tide. I can see myself reading this author's books for many years.</p><p></p></p><p>I was born and raised in Florida and now live in Tennessee. The South is as much a main character in my books as any of the people that populate them. From dirt roads in Alabama to coastal fishing towns in the Florida Panhandle, the south is so wonderfully filled with atmosphere and interesting people that I don&#39;t really see any reason for my writing to leave home. I write the occasional literary or women&#39;s fiction book, but my time is focused right now on The Forgotten Coast Florida series. This series, set in Apalachicola, FL, is a noirish suspense series, dripping with atmosphere and flawed, human, witty characters. The first four books in the series have an overarcing story that isn&#39;t resolved until book four (Landfall, releasing at the end of July 2015), but also subplots and mayhem and overall sinister dealings that are resolved in each book. The first four books are a foundation for the rest of the series, which will serve more as standalone novels. Whether you&#39;re reading See You or one of the Forgotten Coast books, you&#39;ll find they have in common dry humor, a good deal of atmosphere and characters who are people, rather than caricatures. I love these people, from 90-year old Creole nanny Miss Evangeline, to the droll and honorable Jack Canfield, to strong but damaged cop Maggie Redmond, and even the hilariously inappropriate and dangerously charming bad guy, Bennett Boudreaux. I hope that you&#39;ll meet them all, and love them all as I do.</p><h2>Man Ray</h2><p><p>An exciting monograph dedicated to an extraordinary figure and one of last century&#x2019;s most famous and influential artists. Man Ray (1890-1976) was a photographer, painter, and creator of objects, experimental films, and images which were at times enigmatic. This catalog, which presents more than 200 works and compares and contrasts images with biographical details, is divided into three main sections: Man Ray&#x2019;s formative years spent between New York and an artists&#x2019; colony in Ridgefield, New Jersey; the Paris period; and the period spent between Hollywood and Paris, France-the city he ultimately chose to adopt as his home.</p><p>The publication describes the creation of some of his most famous pieces and the motifs-very often of females-that inspired the works. Man Ray&#x2019;s life was marked by a succession of love affairs with famous and intriguing women, and this catalog dedicates several sections to this topic. </p><p>The book also deals with the themes permeating Man Ray&#x2019;s work throughout the years, such as his passion for chess, the relationship between reality and illusion, and experimental photography and film. Comparisons are also made with the works of some of the most important artists of the twentieth century, such as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Constantin Brancusi, Jean Arp, and Francis Picabia.</p></p><p><p>Guido Comis is an art critic and an independent curator.

Avoiding a lecture from Mama Junebug, the kitty boy slips into his closet . . . and finds himself in ancient Egypt. His doggy pals, Los Chimichangos, want to visit the Under <i>Mundo</i>&#x2014;the underworld&#x2014; where mummitos rest in peas. But they need El Skippito's brains and courage to answer the riddle of theFinx and enter the mummy's tomb. Our hero is up to the task, and he's in for another grand and whirlwind adventure.<p> Full of Judy Schachner's rollicking wordplay and bold, imaginative illustrations, Skippy's latest outsize outing will tickle the funny bones and warm the hearts of his many <i>amigos.</i></p></p><p>Best known for her Skippyjon Jones series, Judy Schachner has illustrated many of her own stories, including the much-loved <i>Grannyman </i>and its companion book, <i>Bits &amp; Pieces</i>. She lives in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Another tale featuring the independent, stubborn Siamese kitten. Once again, Skippyjon dons mask and cape, enters his closet, and changes into El Skippito Friskito, an adventure-loving Chihuahua. Here, after daydreaming about ancient Egypt, he converts into his alter ego and meets his <i>amigos</i> (a pack of troublemaking poochitos) along the Nile River. Skippyjon fans will find much to like here&#x2013;the <i>amigos</i> speak a slang of Spanish and English and spur the frightened kitten into confronting the Sphinx and a mummy&#x2013;but the book may be a bit confusing for newcomers as there is no explanation of his transformation or his canine pals. Done in acrylics and pen and ink, the vibrantly colored illustrations add humor to the already silly story (the gang wants to visit the Under Mundo where mummitos rest in peas) and children will want to stop and pore over the details (the mummy is a Siamese). The text is lengthy, with several points of action, so it is recommended for readers who can follow the longer format. However, the narrative is broken up by songs and rhymes that will keep them laughing throughout. When Skippyjon returns to his (real) mummy, youngsters will feel as if they have been to ancient Egypt with him.<i>&#x2013;Susan E.

In this masterful, enthralling, tender novel, which ranges from the Ontario silver rush of the early 1900s to swinging London in the 1960s, she gently reveals the intricacies and anguish of family life, the push and pull of responsibility and individual desire, the way we can face tragedy, and in time, hope to start again.</p></p><p>MARY LAWSON was born and brought up in a small farming community in Ontario.

She put her suitcase (the biggest she could find, purchased from Hudson&#x2019;s Bay) on the bed and a large cardboard box (free of charge from Marshall&#x2019;s Grocery) on the floor beside it and anything that wouldn&#x2019;t fit into the one had to go into the other. She was ruthless about it; she intended to travel light. Out went any items of clothing she hadn&#x2019;t worn for a year or more, any shoes ditto, any odd socks or underwear with holes in it that she had saved for days that didn&#x2019;t matter, in full knowledge of the fact that none of her days mattered, or at least not in a way that required respectable underwear. Out went the debris left in the bottom of drawers: safety pins, bobby pins, fraying hair ribbons, a beaded bracelet with half the beads missing, the remains of a box made of birch bark and decorated with porcupine quills, ancient elastic bands looking so much like desiccated earthworms that she had to close her eyes when she picked them up and a quill pen fashioned from an eagle&#x2019;s feather, made for her by Tom when he was at the eagle&#x2019;s feather stage.<br><br>She threw out a bottle of perfume the twins had given her for Christmas one year, the name of which&#x2014;�Ambush&#x2014;�had made her father laugh out loud, an exceedingly rare occurrence, and followed it with a hideous blue plastic brush and comb set (a Christmas present from Corey), a pink velvet jewelry case containing a mock-�diamond ring that had turned her finger green (a Christmas present from Peter), a black velvet Alice band (from her mother) and a fluffy collie dog she&#x2019;d won in a prize draw at a fund-�raising day at school when she was much too old for such things.<br><br>Out went a large part of her childhood, in fact. What&#x2019;s over is over.<br><br>Into her suitcase, along with the decent underwear, went blouses, sweaters, skirts (summer and winter), jeans, two summer dresses that she still liked, her one decent pair of pajamas, her saddle shoes and her one and only pair of smart shoes (white, with little heels), bought for her high-�school graduation and worn exactly once thereafter, six months ago, when Patrick took her out for dinner down in New Liskeard for a birthday treat. She&#x2019;d be wearing her winter boots, which was just as well because they&#x2019;d have taken up half the case.<br><br>Also into the suitcase went a miniature travel sewing kit (a twelfth birthday present from her mother that Megan had considered rather pointless at the time because she never went anywhere but that now, after nine years in the bottom of a drawer, might come in handy), a hot water bottle (she couldn&#x2019;t sleep without one) and a photo of the whole family, or as much of it as had existed at the time, taken by a traveling magician who had come boiling up the long and dusty road to Struan one summer&#x2019;s day in an ancient overheated Packard hearse. Megan had no idea where he had come from or where he went, but she remembered the evening he entertained the town. He&#x2019;d put on a performance in the church hall and the entire population of Struan had attended, even her father, who never went to anything. She remembered the magician up on the stage, a tall thin figure, elegant in tails and top hat, producing streams of brightly colored scarves out of nowhere, causing them to flow through the air like birds. He&#x2019;d whirled hoops around, passing them through each other in impossible ways, and danced with a cane to the tune of &#x201c;Yes! We Have No Bananas,&#x201d; played on an ancient gramophone borrowed from the school.<br><br>The next day the magician had set up a makeshift studio in one corner of the hall, pinning up as a backdrop a sheet with a Venetian canal painted on it, and took photographs of whoever wanted them, which was practically everyone, a great sprawling gaggle of farmers and miners and men from the lumber mill and teachers and shop owners and even a few loggers from the camp upriver, all in their Sunday best, all wanting a photo of themselves and their families, if any, something to record their existence, to anchor them to this place and this time: Struan, Northern Ontario, via Venice, circa (Megan studied the photo and decided she must have been about ten, which made it eleven years ago) 1954.<br><br>Again, Megan&#x2019;s father had come along and, astonishingly, had submitted to having his photograph taken with his family, so there they all were: Father and Mother standing at the back (Father looking impatient and Mother looking anxious, Megan thought, as though she were wondering if she&#x2019;d left something on the stove). Mother was holding Henry, who was a few months old at the time. In front of them, arranged by height (which at that stage was also by age), were Tom, Megan and the twins, Donald and Gary.<br><br>Henry, the baby, had been born with a hole in his heart and died six months after the photo was taken. Peter, Corey and Adam hadn&#x2019;t been born yet. Before Adam made his appearance, Megan&#x2019;s mother had a stillbirth and two miscarriages, so he was the youngest by eight years.<br><br>In addition to filching the family photo, Megan sorted through a shoebox full of other old photographs, mostly taken by Tom with a Box Brownie, and found one of Peter and Corey playing on the beach and another of Adam when he was a couple of months old. At the bottom of the box there was one of her and Tom up in a tree, and she took that too. She couldn&#x2019;t recall ever climbing a tree and had no idea who had taken the photo (Tom was the only member of the family interested in photography), but she liked it, so she took it.<br><br>She felt no guilt about stealing the photos; no one else in the family ever looked at them and she was sure they wouldn&#x2019;t be missed. She put them in an envelope and slid it under everything else so that it would lie flat on the bottom of the suitcase. Then she tried to close the case and found she couldn&#x2019;t. She removed two sweaters, two skirts and the smart white shoes, leaned on the case, managed to close it and do up its shiny new latches and discovered she couldn&#x2019;t even lift it off the bed. So out came everything and she had another cull and then, at last, it was done.<br><br>She stepped back and surveyed her room. Nothing left. No dolls to linger over even if she&#x2019;d been the lingering type; with all those babies in the family the last thing she&#x2019;d needed was a doll. Likewise no dollhouses or miniature tea sets; &#x201c;playing house&#x201d; had very little appeal if you spent your days doing the real thing. Nothing on the window sills or on the walls, nothing on her narrow wooden desk. A clean sweep; it was immensely satisfying. Adam would have the room, she decided. Then he would no longer wake Peter and Corey or vice versa. When she came back for visits she would share with him.<br><br>The cardboard box full of rejects she stashed in the garage; she would sort through it later for serviceable clothes that could go to the Goodwill and take the rest to the dump. The contents of the suitcase went back, neatly folded, into cupboards and drawers to await departure day. The suitcase itself she put under the stairs.<br><br>What next? Megan thought, consulting her mental list. She&#x2019;d already asked Mrs. Jarvis, who came in on Mondays to help with the laundry and the cleaning, to come on Thursdays as well, starting in two weeks&#x2019; time. She&#x2019;d made sure the house was stocked up with all the staples&#x2014;�tins of food, toilet paper, laundry soap. She would change all the sheets and do the laundry the Monday before she left.<br><br>That&#x2019;s it, she thought. All that remained was to tell her family and Patrick that finally&#x2014;�finally&#x2014;�after years of thwarted attempts, she was leaving home.<br><br>She started with her mother because that would be the hardest. The second hardest was going to be Patrick, but she wouldn&#x2019;t be seeing him until Saturday.<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving?&#x201d; her mother said, looking incredulous. You&#x2019;d have thought no one had ever left home before, despite the fact that Tom had been gone for over two years. But of course, Megan thought grimly, Tom was a boy. No one batted an eye when a boy left home. If anything it was cause for celebration.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m twenty-�one, Mum.&#x201d; She dusted the kitchen counter with flour and began kneading a lump of pastry the size and heft of a cannonball. It was late afternoon and they were alone in the kitchen, preparing supper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time I left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why does being twenty-�one mean it&#x2019;s time you left?&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother was peeling potatoes, but she stopped, her arms in the sink, to stare at Megan.<br><br>Megan sliced the cannonball in half, briefly kneaded both halves, set one aside and began rolling out the other with brisk sweeps of the rolling pin. A small crease had appeared between her eyebrows. She&#x2019;d known it would be like this. It&#x2019;s your own fault, she thought. You should have gone years ago.<br><br>&#x201c;I told you I was going to go, Mum. When you were pregnant with Adam I said I&#x2019;d wait until he&#x2019;d arrived and settled in and then I&#x2019;d be off. Remember?&#x201d; She scanned her mother&#x2019;s face for any sign that she recalled the conversation. Not a trace. Lately Megan had started to wonder if her mother was going senile, but surely she couldn&#x2019;t be&#x2014;�she was only forty-�five. More likely she&#x2019;d simply erased it from her mind. She&#x2019;d always been good at not hearing things she didn&#x2019;t want to hear; maybe forgetting was an extension of the same thing.<br><br>&#x201c;That was a year and a half ago,&#x201d; Megan said, flipping the pastry over and rolling it out again. &#x201c;I had to put it off because after Adam was born you weren&#x2019;t well. And then Adam got whooping cough, so I put it off again. Then Peter and Corey got flu. Then you got flu . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother&#x2019;s eyes had an unfocused, inward look as if she were searching through dusty files down in the basement of her brain.<br><br>&#x201c;Now everybody is fine,&#x201d; Megan said firmly. &#x201c;Tom&#x2019;s gone and the twins will be off soon and Adam&#x2019;s a very easy baby.&#x201d;<br><br>She could have added that she also happened to know that he would be the last baby, because in the aftermath of Adam&#x2019;s birth she&#x2019;d overheard Dr. Christopherson telling her father so. She&#x2019;d been coming downstairs with a pile of dirty laundry and heard the doctor, who was in the living room with her father, say, &#x201c;This must be the last child, Edward.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan had paused on the stairs with her armful of dirty sheets. Her father mumbled something she couldn&#x2019;t catch, his voice strangled by embarrassment. The doctor said, &#x201c;That may be so, Edward. It may be her wish. But you have a say in the matter too, and for the sake of your other children&#x2014;�for all your sakes&#x2014;�it must stop now. She is worn out.&#x201d;<br><br>At last! Megan thought. At last! The way her parents kept on having children was just plain ridiculous, in her opinion. It wasn&#x2019;t as if they were Catholics.<br><br>Now she looked at her mother to check that she was listening. &#x201c;So now&#x2019;s the perfect time for me to go,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time I started my own life.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;d rehearsed that last line, but inside her head it hadn&#x2019;t sounded so corny. Her mother looked aggrieved.<br><br>&#x201c;Megan, what nonsense! &#x2018;Starting your own life!&#x2019; As if you didn&#x2019;t have a life here!&#x201d; Suddenly she turned to fully face her daughter, the paring knife in one hand and a half-�peeled potato in the other. Water trickled down her arms to her elbows and onto the floor. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re marrying Patrick McArthur,&#x201d; she said. She looked appalled.<br><br>&#x201c;MacDonald,&#x201d; Megan said. &#x201c;No, Mother&#x201d; (she called her mother &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; when she was annoyed with her), &#x201c;I am not marrying Patrick MacDonald. I&#x2019;m not marrying anybody. I&#x2019;m going to Toronto. You&#x2019;re dripping all over the floor.&#x201d;<br><br>The kitchen door opened and Peter, age ten, prowled in, eyes scanning left and right, searching for something edible, anything at all.<br><br>&#x201c;Out,&#x201d; Megan said, pointing a floured finger at the door.<br><br>Peter clutched his belly and made an anguished face.<br><br>&#x201c;Out!&#x201d; Megan said, louder, and he left.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Jarvis will be coming in on Thursdays as well as Mondays to help with the cleaning,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ll do a big shopping before I go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t told me why you&#x2019;re going! That&#x2019;s what I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d; There was a tremor in her mother&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>Megan hardened her heart. I don&#x2019;t care, she thought. I do not, will not, care. I&#x2019;m going. And anyway, it will be good for her. She needs to take charge again. She&#x2019;s been depending on me too much.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving for another two weeks,&#x201d; she said, striving for the right mix of firmness and reassurance. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll come back and visit. I&#x2019;m only going to Toronto, remember.&#x201d; Initially, at any rate, she added to herself.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand you, Megan,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;All these years, and now suddenly out of nowhere you say you&#x2019;re leaving. Truly, honestly, I do not understand you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Megan said, her tone more gentle now that it was over. &#x201c;You never have.&#x201d; She thought how pretty her mother was still&#x2014;�even now, when she was upset. Her face was as round and smooth as a child&#x2019;s.<br><br>Her father was next. He would be easier, Megan thought, if only because he wouldn&#x2019;t care so much. Nonetheless, an audience with her father always made her anxious. Whenever you knocked on the door of his study he gave the impression that you were interrupting him in the middle of something critically important.<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving?&#x201d; he said, gazing at her from behind his desk. Abutting the desk at one end there was a long table heaped with books and at the other end there was a small bookcase, so that he was surrounded on three sides. Like a fortress, Megan thought. A fortress of books. Protecting him from us.<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving home? Or leaving Struan altogether?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Both,&#x201d; Megan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Toronto to start with. And then when I&#x2019;ve saved up enough money I&#x2019;d like to go to En�gland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;En�gland?&#x201d; He looked startled, which Megan found gratifying. &#x201c;Why En�gland?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a friend there. Cora Manning. You remember Mr. Manning, the pharmacist? They moved to En�gland a few years ago. Cora works in London now. She shares a house with friends. I could stay with her; she&#x2019;s invited me. And I&#x2019;d like to see En�gland.&#x201d;</p><h2>Barre Fitness: Barre Exercises You Can Do Anywhere for Flexibility, Core Strength, and a Lean Body</h2><p><p><b>Step up to the barre and strengthen your core with 100 at-home barre exercises!</b></p><p>Infused with elements of ballet, barre classes were introduced by Lotte Berk in the 1970s as a new way to combine dance with traditional exercise.

Her willful and sometimes flaky mother is driving her crazy, and Hannah has decided that she&#x2019;s in love with Doc Ford, star of White&#x2019;s other series. But Doc takes off unexpectedly for Venezuela, and Hannah&#x2019;s life becomes far dicier: a bogus charity that is scamming senior citizens is really a front for a real-estate-development scheme that could wipe out Hannah&#x2019;s tiny home town, and the people behind the scheme are utterly ruthless. Strong-willed and tough-minded, Hannah is also suspicious of just about everyone she encounters, and some of these suspicions function as red herrings. Bogus charities and rapacious real-estate developers are as quintessentially Florida as orange juice, but White also tosses in other Florida verities, including willful destruction of ecological and anthropological treasures, industrial-scale Medicare fraud, and the heyday of Florida drug smuggling and its tragic impact on thousands of Floridians. But the reliance on familiar themes in Florida crime fiction is no quibble; Hannah brings a fresh perspective to White&#x2019;s much-loved southwest Florida world. --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>You Play The Girl: On Playboy Bunnies, Stepford Wives, Train Wrecks, &amp; Other Mixed Messages</h2><p><b>WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FOR CRITICISM<br> A FINALIST FOR THE PEN/DIAMONSTEIN-SPIELVOGEL AWARD FOR THE ART OF THE ESSAY<br><br> "If Hollywood's treatment of women leaves you wanting, you'll find good, heady company in <i>You Play the Girl</i>."&#x2014;<i>ELLE</i></b><br><br> As a kid in the 1970s and 80s, Carina Chocano was confused by the mixed messages&nbsp;all around her; messages&nbsp;that told her who she could be&#x2014;and who she couldn&#x2019;t. Dutifully absorbing all the conflicting information the culture has to offer on how to be a woman,&nbsp;Chocano grappled with&nbsp;sexed up sidekicks, princesses waiting to be saved, and morally infallible angels who seemed to have no opinions of their own. She learned that "the girl" is not a person, but a man's idea of what a woman should be&#x2014;she&#x2019;s&nbsp;whatever the hero needs her to be in order to become himself. It wasn't until she spent five years as a movie critic, and was laid off just after her daughter was born, however, that she really came to understand how the stories the culture tells us about what it means to be a girl&nbsp;limit our lives and shape our destinies. She resolved to rewrite her own story.<br><br> In <i>You Play the Girl</i>, Chocano blends formative personal stories with insightful and emotionally powerful analysis. Moving from Bugs Bunny to Playboy Bunnies, from&nbsp;<i>Flashdance&nbsp;</i>to<i>&nbsp;Frozen,</i>&nbsp;from the progressive &#x2019;70s through the backlash &#x2019;80s, the glib &#x2019;90s, and the pornified&nbsp;aughts&#x2014;and at stops in between&#x2014;she explains how growing up in the shadow of &#x201c;the girl&#x201d; taught her to think about herself and the world and what it means to raise a daughter in the face of these contorted reflections. In the tradition of Roxane Gay, Rebecca Solnit, and Susan Sontag,&nbsp;Chocano brilliantly shows that our identities are more fluid than we think, and certainly more complex than anything we see on any kind of screen.</p><p>CARINA CHOCANO&nbsp;is a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine.

Here Erzsi discovers that her new husband prefers wandering back alleys on his own to her company. The trouble picks up in Ravenna, where a hostile man zooms up on a motorcycle as the couple are sitting at an outdoor caf�. It&#x2019;s J�nos, someone Mih�ly hasn&#x2019;t seen for years, and he wants Mih�ly to come with him in search of Ervin, their childhood friend. The trouble comes to a head when Mih�ly misses the train he and Erzsi are due to take to Rome. Off he goes across Italy, wandering from city to city, haunted and accosted by a strange array of figures from the troubled youth that he thought he had left behind: There are the charismatic siblings, �va and Tam�s, whose bizarre amateur theatricals linked sex and death forever in his mind; Ervin, a Jew turned Catholic monk who was his rival for �va&#x2019;s love; and again, that ruffian on the motorcycle. <br><br>Antal Szerb&#x2019;s dreamlike adventure, like Bulgakov&#x2019;s <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, is an intoxicating, utterly individual mix of magic, madness, eros, and menace.

He studied German and English literature at the University of Budapest, receiving a PhD in 1924. Throughout the second half of the 1920s he lived in France, Italy, and England, where he worked on his first book, <i>An Outline of English Literature </i>(1929). In 1933 he was elected the president of the Hungarian Literary Academy and the next year published his <i>History of Hungarian Literature</i>, called by John Lukacs, &#x201c;not only a classic but a sensitive and profound description of . . . the Magyar mind.&#x201d; It was followed in 1941 by a three-volume <i>History of World Literature</i>. In addition to his critical writings, Szerb produced many works of translation, and published newspaper articles, essays, reviews, short stories, and novels, of which <i>The Pendragon Legend</i> (1934), <i>Love in a Bottle</i> (1935), <i>The Third Tower </i>(written in 1936), <i>Journey by Moonlight </i>(1937), <i>Oliver VII</i> (1937), and <i>The Queen&#x2019;s Necklace </i>(1943) have been translated into English. Having lost his university teaching position as a result of Hungary&#x2019;s anti-Semitic laws, Szerb was sent to a labor camp, where it is believed he was beaten to death.

The purpose of the lectures was to provide students with a firm foundation in spiritual science and practice and to prepare them for Paul Case's rendition of the Golden Dawn Order. <p>When this coursework was expanded in 1924, the contents of the "The First Year Course" became known as Section A, `The Life Power', and Section B,`The Seven Steps of Spiritual Unfoldment'. The `Life Power' provided a firm foundation of Occult Fundamentals and the `The Seven Steps of Spiritual Unfoldment' utilized the Major Arcana of the Tarot to communicate the stages of Spiritual Evolution. </p><p>The early writings of Paul Foster Case are exceptionally clear and represent some of his finest work. Anyone approaching these lessons for the first time are encouraged to spend at least two weeks on each before proceeding to the next. This is precisely the manner in which the lectures and lessons were intended to be assimilated. Paul Case utilizes images in addition to words to communicate principles. Proceeding in such a manner will allow the corresponding ideas to take root and mature and thus facilitate understanding of the next lesson in the series.</p></p><p>"Dr. Paul Clark was one of the seven Stewards that trained under B.O.T.A. head Ann Davies receiving the advanced teachings of the Order. This well written book includes a short biography of Paul Foster Case by Paul Clark which includes many previously little known areas of the life and association with Master R who became Case's lifetime guide. The gems within this book are presented in such a manner that they shine a new light on the teachings of Paul Case and explain many nuances of Case's teaching that are not readily apparent. This is an excellent book from a high caliber teacher of the Golden Dawn and is a must for any Golden Dawn enthusiast." --<i>Pat Zalewski, renown author of 'The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn'</i><br><br>"Paul Foster Case has been instrumental in unveiling the most profound mysteries of the Tarot, the Qabalah, and other important facets of the Western Esoteric Tradition in an approachable manner. His best known works, including The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages, The True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order, and The Book of Tokens are true gems of wisdom that continue to inspire and inform new generations of spiritual seekers. However, as noted by Dr. Paul Clark in the biographical introduction to Occult Fundamentals and Spiritual Unfoldment, the author behind these treasures has often been a mystery to his readers. Case's early writings, compiled by the Fraternity of the Hidden Light in this new book, provide further proof of Case's substantial esoteric knowledge and insight. It is a most welcome addition to the illuminating body of work we have come to expect from a masterful teacher." --<i>Chic and Tabatha Cicero, Chief Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</i></p><h2>Watch Me: A Memoir</h2><p>Academy Award-winning actress Huston&#x2019;s &#x201c;tireless fascination with the world is thrilling...&#x201d; (<i>Elle</i>), and <i>Watch Me</i> is an &#x201c;elegant and entertaining&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) account of her seventeen-year love affair with Jack Nicholson, her rise to stardom, and her mastery of the craft of acting.<br><br>Picking up where her first memoir<i> A Story Lately Told</i> leaves off, <i>Watch Me</i> is a chronicle of Anjelica Huston&#x2019;s glamorous and eventful Hollywood years. &#x201c;With a conversational intimacy, inhabiting the role of the new best friend&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>), she writes about falling in love with Jack Nicholson and her adventurous, turbulent, high-profile, spirited relationship with him and his intoxicating circle of friends.

It was there, at the age of twenty-one, that I parted ways with Bob Richardson, the man I had lived with for the last four years, a bold and provocative fashion photographer twenty-four years older than I, with whom I&#x2019;d been involved in a tempestuous affair. Until this moment we had been sharing an apartment in Gramercy Park, New York. Had it not been for the presence of my father and his latest wife, Cici, with whom Bob and I had just been vacationing in La Paz, Mexico, I doubt that I ever would have had the final stroke of courage it would take to leave him.<br> <br>I would be staying temporarily at the ranch house in the Pacific Palisades that Cici had owned prior to her marriage to Dad and that she was redecorating to accommodate some treasures from our old life at St. Clerans, a pastoral estate in the west of Ireland where I grew up with my brother Tony&#x2014;before we moved with our mother to London; before the birth of my half siblings, Danny and Allegra; before I acted in a movie at the age of sixteen with my father directing; before my mother&#x2019;s death by car crash in 1969, a cataclysmic experience that for me ended that beautiful, hopeful decade, when I moved from England to America.<br> <br>One morning early in my stay at Cici&#x2019;s, I ordered a taxi and told the driver to take me to Hollywood. &#x201c;Do you mean Vine Street?&#x201d; he asked vaguely. I had guessed that Hollywood wasn&#x2019;t really a place but rather a state of mind, with a great many parking lots sandwiched between shops and storefronts advertising sex and liquor.<br> <br>But oddly, there was a sense of coming home to California. Although I had grown up in Europe, I was born in Los Angeles. The desert skies were clear blue and untroubled. Living with my father again felt strange, but he would be leaving soon to resume work on The Mackintosh Man in New York.<br> <br>I was eager to buy some marabou bedroom stilettos to match the pink swan&#x2019;s-down-trimmed negligee that Cici had generously just given me. Driving along Sunset in the pale sunshine, I noticed that the panorama was bare and garish, mostly warehouses and two-story facades. There were rows of tall palm trees and purple jacarandas. The air was windy and dry and sweet-scented. Beverly Hills, it seemed, was all about who you were, what you were driving, your pastimes, and your playgrounds.<br> <br>A few days before, Cici had taken me shopping on Rodeo Drive, where there was a yellow-striped awning above Giorgio&#x2019;s boutique, with outdoor atomizers that puffed their signature Giorgio perfume. Indulgent husbands drank espresso at a shiny brass bar inside as their wives shopped for feathered gowns and beaded cocktail dresses. For lingerie, the local sirens went to Juel Park, who was known to seal the deal for many aspirants based on the strength of her hand-stitched negligees and satin underwear trimmed with French lace. We lunched at the Luau, a Polynesian watering hole, the darkest oasis on the street, where you could hear rummy confessions from the next-door booth as you tucked behind your ear a fresh gardenia from the scorpion punch. Los Angeles was a small town then; it felt both incredibly glamorous and a little provincial.<br> <br>Cici, who was in her mid-thirties, had a son, Collin, by a former marriage to the documentary filmmaker and screenwriter Walon Green. Cici had gone to private schools in Beverly Hills and Montecito, and her friends were the hot beauties of the day, from Jill St. John and Stefanie Powers to Bo Derek and Stephanie Zimbalist&#x2014;glamorous sportswomen and great horseback riders who had grown up privileged in the western sunbelt. She had played baseball with Elvis Presley at Beverly Glen Park in the fifties and roomed with Grace Slick at Finch College in New York. Cici also had a lively retinue of gay friends who were sportive and gossipy and informal.<br> <br>Cici&#x2019;s energy was buoyant. She cursed like a sailor and loved a bit of illicit fun, as did I. Our practice, at least a couple of times a week, was to do an impromptu raid on other people&#x2019;s gardens in the neighboring canyons. I would wield the shears, and with a trunkful of flowers and branches, Cici would drive her candy-apple-red Maserati like a getaway car, burning rubber to peals of laughter; although we tempted fate, for some miraculous reason we never got caught. Sometimes Allegra would accompany us on these forays.<br> <br>After the sale of St. Clerans, Allegra had moved in with her Irish nanny, Kathleen Shine, whom we called &#x201c;Nurse,&#x201d; to share a rented house in Santa Monica with Gladys Hill, Dad&#x2019;s co-writer and secretary. Heartbroken by the death of our mother and still painfully loyal to her, Nurse had been a staple of Tony&#x2019;s and my childhood. Gladys was calm, deliberate, intelligent, and kind. A pale-complexioned woman with ice-blond hair from West Virginia, she was devoted to Dad and shared his passion for pre-Columbian art. She had worked for him in the previous decade and was part of the family in Ireland when I was growing up.<br> <br>Allegra was going on nine and was extremely smart; it was already her intention to go to Oxford University. From the time she was a baby, she&#x2019;d had an innate, deep wisdom and a sweet formality about her.<br> <br>I looked up Jeremy Railton, a handsome Rhodesian friend from my former life, when I was going to school in London. He had been designing the sets for a play by Ntozake Shange, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, and was living in an apartment on Fountain Avenue. We picked up our friendship where we&#x2019;d left off five years before. He introduced me to his social circle, which included the comedy writer Kenny Solms and his collaborator, Gail Parent; the talent agent Sandy Gallin; Michael Douglas and Brenda Vaccaro; Paula and Lisa Weinstein; and Neil Diamond. Kenny and Gail wrote for The Carol Burnett Show and numerous television specials for Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, and Julie Andrews.<br> <br>Cici knew that I was still shaken from my split with Bob Richardson. She did her best to take me out and introduce me to people, but I was more interested in riding her horses and walking in the next-door garden. She and Dad had just celebrated the completion of a new Jacuzzi, and one afternoon I found the actor Don Johnson and a male friend of his floating in it. Though I was grateful to Cici for her efforts, I was somewhat embarrassed and ran back to the camellia trees.<br> <br>A Swedish friend of hers, Brigitta, who owned Strip Thrills, a dress shop on Sunset, told Cici that she was going to a party at Jack Nicholson&#x2019;s house that evening and invited her to come along. Cici asked if she could bring her stepdaughter, and Brigitta said fine, that it was his birthday, and Jack loved pretty girls.<br> <br>I borrowed an evening dress from Cici&#x2014;black, long, open at the back, with a diamant� clasp. Brigitta and another Swedish girl picked us up, and the four of us drove in Brigitta&#x2019;s car to Jack&#x2019;s house on Mulholland Drive, on a high ridge separating Beverly Hills from the San Fernando Valley on the other side. It felt like we were on top of the world.<br> <br>The front door of a modest two-story ranch-style house opened, and there was that smile. Later, after he became a superstar and was on the cover of Time magazine, Diana Vreeland was to christen it &#x201c;The Killer Smile.&#x201d; But at the time I thought, &#x201c;Ah! Yes. Now, there&#x2019;s a man you could fall for.&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1969, when I was still living in London, I had gone with some friends to see Easy Rider in a movie theater in Piccadilly Circus, and had returned alone some days later to see it again. It was Jack&#x2019;s combination of ease and exuberance that had captured me from the moment he came on-screen. I think it was probably upon seeing the film that, like many others, I first fell in love with Jack.<br> <br>The second time was when he opened the door to his house that early evening in April, with the late sun still golden in the sky. &#x201c;Good evening, ladies,&#x201d; he said, beaming, and added in a slow drawl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jack, and I&#x2019;m glad you could make it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He motioned for us to enter. The front room was low-ceilinged, candlelit, and filled with strangers. There was Greek food, and music playing. I danced with Jack for hours. And when he invited me to stay the night, I asked Cici what she thought. &#x201c;Are you kidding?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Of course!&#x201d;<br> <br>In the morning, when I woke up and put on my evening dress from the night before, Jack was already downstairs. Someone I came to recognize later as the screenwriter Robert Towne walked through the front door into the house and looked at me appraisingly as I stood on the upper landing. Then Jack appeared and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna send you home in a taxi, if that&#x2019;s okay, because I&#x2019;m going to a ball game.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cab took me back the half hour to the Palisades. When I got out in the backless evening dress, Cici was at the door. She looked at me and just shook her head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you didn&#x2019;t insist that he drive you home,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What are you thinking? If he&#x2019;s going to take you out again, he must come and pick you up and take you home.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack called a few days later to ask me out. I said, &#x201c;Yes. But you have to pick me up, and you have to drive me home.&#x201d; And he said, &#x201c;Okay. All right. How about Saturday?&#x201d; And I said, &#x201c;Okay. But you have to come and pick me up.&#x201d; Then I got a follow-up call on Saturday saying he was sorry, he had to cancel our date, because he had a previous obligation. &#x201c;Does that make me a secondary one?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not witty enough, and it&#x2019;s derogatory to both of us.&#x201d; I hung up the phone, disappointed. That evening I decided to go out with Jeremy and Kenny Solms and Gail Parent. We were dining at the Old World caf� on Sunset Boulevard, when they started to whisper and giggle. When I asked what was going on, Gail said, &#x201c;You were supposed to see Jack tonight, right?&#x201d; And I replied, &#x201c;Yes, but he had a previous obligation,&#x201d; and Kenny said, &#x201c;Well, his previous obligation is a very pretty blonde, and he just went upstairs with her.&#x201d;<br> <br>I took my wineglass in hand and, with heart pumping, climbed the stairs to the upper section of the restaurant and approached Jack&#x2019;s booth. He was sitting with a beautiful young woman whom I immediately recognized as his ex-girlfriend Michelle Phillips. I had seen them photographed together in magazines when I was living in New York. She was in the group the Mamas and the Papas. As I reached the table, a shadow passed quickly over his face, like a cloud crossing the sun. I lifted my glass airily and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m downstairs, and I just thought I&#x2019;d come up to say hi.&#x201d; He introduced Michelle to me, not missing a beat. She was charming. I guess they were at the end of their relationship at that point. One morning, some weeks later, she drove to his house on Mulholland Drive to collect something she had stored there. Upon discovering that I was with Jack, she came upstairs to his bedroom with two glasses of orange juice. From that moment, we became friends.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>On one of my first dates with Jack, he took me to the races at Hollywood Park. He wore a beautiful cream wool suit with an American flag in rhinestones pinned to his lapel. He got a hard time at the gate to the grandstand for not wearing a tie. Jack gave me fifty dollars&#x2019; betting money. I won sixty-seven and returned his fifty.<br> <br>I was still wrapped up in thoughts of Bob Richardson and the suddenness of our parting. I wrote in a diary I was keeping at the time that I didn&#x2019;t know what was me and what wasn&#x2019;t anymore, that I&#x2019;d been Bob&#x2019;s possession and his construct, saying the things he might say, even smoking his brand of cigarettes. I thought it must be planetary, all this disruption and indecision. Someone said it was fragments of helium floating about the atmosphere, because everyone I met at the time seemed touched by a peculiar madness. Even Richard Nixon had lost his moorings and was on his way to being impeached. In the overture to our relationship, Jack sent mixed messages. Alternately, he would ask me to stick around or would not call when he said he would. At one point he told me he had decided that we should cool it, and followed that up with a call suggesting we dine together. Sometimes he called me &#x201c;Pal,&#x201d; which I hated. It implied a lack of romantic feeling. I didn&#x2019;t want to be his crony but, rather, the love of his life. I thought he was still very involved with Michelle, who seemed to have made up her mind to move along.<br> <br>Jack gave me a variety of nicknames. I started off as &#x201c;Fab.&#x201d; As in &#x201c;The Big Fabulous,&#x201d; which became, with a German accent, &#x201c;Ze Bik Fabuliss.&#x201d; This was because when I first came to Los Angeles, Jeremy and Kenny used to say &#x201c;the most fabulous&#x201d; all the time, a habit that I had adopted. Then, I don&#x2019;t know why, my name developed into &#x201c;Toot,&#x201d; rhyming with &#x201c;foot,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tootie,&#x201d; which became &#x201c;Tootman Fabuliss.&#x201d; Then it became &#x201c;Ze Bik,&#x201d; and then simply &#x201c;Mine,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Minyl.&#x201d; Jack had nicknames for most people. Warren Beatty was &#x201c;The Pro.&#x201d; Marlon Brando was &#x201c;Marloon.&#x201d; Fred Roos was &#x201c;The Rooster.&#x201d; Arthur Garfunkel was &#x201c;The Old New G.&#x201d; Jack had a thing about names. He liked Harry Dean Stanton&#x2019;s name so much that he wrote it somewhere in every film that he did. So, whether it was his initials on a prison wall in graffiti or carved into a tree in a Western, if you look closely at this period of his movies, you&#x2019;ll see HDS somewhere. He called Michelle &#x201c;Rat&#x201d; in the nicest way possible. His car, a magnificent Mercedes 600 the color of black cherries, was christened &#x201c;Bing.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the first things I noticed about Jack was that he had a great many people around who performed all sorts of functions for him. On Saturdays the guys would all sit in the TV room at the back of the house and drink beer and eat hot dogs and watch sports all day. Jack might leap up to demonstrate a slam dunk. As long as he had a friend sitting by, nodding his head, a smile decorating his face, life was good. I think, for the most part, that&#x2019;s all Jack needed. In some ways, he was a man of simple tastes. A receptive and appreciative audience always charmed him.<br> <br>Others had the job of helping Jack keep his life running smoothly. He called his assistant, Annie Marshall, &#x201c;My staff.&#x201d; The daughter of the late actor Herbert Marshall, Annie was tall, dark, and pretty, brilliantly funny, neurotic, and smart as a whip. There was Helena Kallianiotes, who was a complete mystery to me at the beginning. Helena was &#x201c;Boston Blackie&#x201d;; born in Greece, dark and brooding, she had mahogany eyes, a waist-length snarl of black hair, and a compact, lithe body, and had been a belly dancer in Boston. She was also a great cook, and provided the Mediterranean food at Jack&#x2019;s party. She was a fascinating woman, complicated, intense, and secretive. The writer of Five Easy Pieces, Carole Eastman, a very good friend of Jack&#x2019;s, had seen Helena dancing in the late sixties and had been so impressed that she&#x2019;d introduced Helena to Jack and the director, Bob Rafelson, who gave her a small but memorable role in the movie. Knowing she was at loose ends afterward, Jack offered her a position looking after his house. She was living there when we first met, at his party, and eventually moved to a house that he acquired next door.<br> <br>Helena wasn&#x2019;t really a housekeeper. She was Jack&#x2019;s chief of staff, to a degree, although there was often confusion about the running of the house, as Jack would appropriate many people to perform the same task. Helena was also the keeper of his confidences and trust, and always had Jack&#x2019;s best interest at heart. Sometimes they had fights, and he would blame h...</p><h2>Chestnut Street</h2><p>Chestnut Street is a place in Dublin where neighbors come and go.

If only Dolly&#x2019;s mother had been a round, bunlike woman, or a small wrinkled person, it might have been easier for Dolly, this business of growing up. But no, there were no consolations on that score. Mother was tall and willowy and had a smile that made other people smile too and a laugh that caused strangers to look up with pleasure. Mother always knew what to say and said it; Mother wore long lilac silk scarves so elegantly they seemed to flow with her when she walked. If Dolly tried to wear a scarf, either it looked like a bandage or else she got mistaken for a football fan. If you were square and solid and without color or grace, it was sometimes easy to hate Mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But only for a moment, and not real hate. Nobody could hate Mother, and certainly not the dumpy daughter that Mother treated like a princess. She always spoke of Dolly&#x2019;s fine points. Her lovely deep--green eyes. People will get lost in those eyes, Mother had said. Dolly doubted it&#x2014;-there was precious little sign of anyone looking into them for long enough to realize that they were green, let alone run the risk of sinking hopelessly into their depths. Mother always called on Father to admire Dolly&#x2019;s wonderful texture of hair. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Mother would say excitedly. &#x201c;Look at how thick it is and how healthy it is; we may well see the shampoo companies begging Doll to do advertisements for them.&#x201d; Father would look obediently and with some mild surprise as if he had been called to see a kingfisher that had just disappeared. He would nod eagerly to please his wife and daughter. Oh, yes, he would agree. A fine shock of hair, all right, no molting there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly would examine her dull brown hair without pleasure. The only thing to be said in its favor was that there was a lot of it. And that was what Mother had unerringly been able to identify and fasten on in her extravagant compliments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the girls at school loved Dolly&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;-she was so friendly they said, so interested in them. She remembered all their names. They loved coming round to the house on Chestnut Street on Saturday afternoons. Dolly&#x2019;s mother used to let them play with her old makeup. Ends of lipsticks, little, nearly empty pots of eye shadow, compacts almost worn away by dabbing. There was a big mirror with a good light where they could practice; all Dolly&#x2019;s mother insisted was that every trace of it be removed with cold cream and tissues before they went home. She managed to make them believe that this was what kept the skin healthy and fresh, and Dolly&#x2019;s friends enjoyed the cleansing almost as much as they had liked the painting of their young faces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly&#x2019;s friends. Were they really friends, she often wondered, or did they just like her because of Mother? At school they didn&#x2019;t make much of her. After class Dolly often sat alone while others went off arm in arm. She was never the center of any laughing crowd in the playground, nobody chose her to go shopping after school, she was usually one of the last to be picked for any team. Even poor Olive, who was fat and had thick, whirly round spectacles, often got picked before Dolly. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Mother she might have sunk without trace in that school. She should be very, very grateful that, unlike almost everyone else around her, she had a parent who was universally approved and liked. She should be grateful, and she usually was. She was happiest playing with her cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother always baked a funny cake for the sale of work, not a big showy one that would embarrass you or a little mean one that would make you feel ashamed, but like the one covered in Smarties, or the one with nasturtium flowers on it and a cutting from a newspaper saying that they were safe to eat. Mother had lent marvelous things for the school play and hadn&#x2019;t complained when they got torn. Mother had asked Miss Power for the knitting pattern of her cardigan, and then had actually gone and knitted the thing, telling Miss Power that she had chosen a different color in case they looked like identical twins. Poor Miss Power, plain as a pikestaff and not willowy and lovely like Mother, had pinked with pleasure and had become nearer to human than any of them had ever seen her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Dolly&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, Mother was making a marvelous production. And every step of the way she consulted her daughter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, you must tell me what you&#x2019;d like and what the other girls do. There&#x2019;s nothing so silly as a mother getting it all wrong, and taking you to the pictures and McDonald&#x2019;s when that&#x2019;s far too young for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d never get it wrong, Mother,&#x201d; Dolly said in a dead sort of voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But of course I would, darling Doll. I&#x2019;m a hundred years older than you and all your friends. I have ideas from the last century. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m relying on you to say what you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t a hundred years older than us.&#x201d; Dolly&#x2019;s tone was level. &#x201c;You were twenty--three when I was born; you&#x2019;re not forty yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, but soon will be.&#x201d; Mother sighed and looked at her perfect face in the mirror. &#x201c;Soon a wizened, stooped, eccentric old forty--year--old.&#x201d; She pealed with laughter and Dolly laughed too. The notion was so ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do when you were sixteen?&#x201d; Dolly asked, trying to put off the moment when she would have to say she didn&#x2019;t know how to stage the celebration, and was dreading it in any form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, love, that was so long ago. And it was a Friday, so we all did what everyone did then&#x2014;-we watched <i>Ready, Steady, Go!</i> on the television, and we had sausages and a birthday cake and we played all the Beatles on my record player. And then we went to a coffee bar and drank cups of frothy coffee and giggled and everyone went home on the bus.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds lovely,&#x201d; Dolly said wistfully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it was the Dark Ages,&#x201d; Mother admitted ruefully. &#x201c;Nowadays things are much more advanced. I suppose you&#x2019;ll all want to go to a disco? What did the others do? Jenny&#x2019;s sixteen, Mary must be sixteen, Judy?&#x201d; Mother looked at her brightly, listing the names of Dolly&#x2019;s friends, alert and interested. Caring that her daughter should not be left out of whatever was the scene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I think Jenny just went out to the pictures,&#x201d; Dolly said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course she had Nick&#x2014;-that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Dolly&#x2019;s mother nodded sagely. She was the confidante of all the girls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what Judy did.&#x201d; Dolly was mulish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But you must, darling. She&#x2019;s your friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s face softened visibly. Dolly could see a change of approach. The note was soothing now. &#x201c;Of course, of course, and let&#x2019;s not forget she may have done nothing at all. Or just had a family gathering. No, there&#x2019;s no reason why you should know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly felt worse than ever now. She was revealed to Mother as a person whose friends had celebrations without her, but as someone so pathetic that she had to give some kind of cringe--making party herself so as to buy their friendship. Dolly&#x2019;s heart was heavy. She knew her face looked heavy and sad as well. She wished she could smile for this bright and lovely mother who was trying to help her, who had always been there supporting and suggesting and admiring. But the smile wouldn&#x2019;t come to her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother would have every reason to play the martyr, to feel that her daughter was monstrously ungrateful. But Mother never behaved like that. Judy&#x2019;s mother was constantly saying that daughters were a scourge to the flesh and a torment to the soul. Jenny&#x2019;s mother was like a Special Branch officer, so suspicious was she of even the most innocent activities. Mary&#x2019;s mother looked like a medieval painting of a mourning Madonna; she seemed stooped under the weight of her responsibility for a teenage girl. Only Dolly&#x2019;s mother was full of hope and plans and enthusiasm. Wasn&#x2019;t it bad luck that when the cards were being given out she had been dealt dull old Dolly instead of someone more colorful and lively who could respond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you so nice to me, Mother?&#x201d; Dolly asked seriously. She really and truly wanted to know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s face showed hardly any surprise at the question. She answered it as cheerfully and with the same kind of smile that greeted almost everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being nice, darling, I&#x2019;m being ordinary&nbsp;. . . but it&#x2019;s your sixteenth birthday and that should be a happy day, something you&#x2019;ll remember&nbsp;. . . even if it&#x2019;s silly, like mine was. At least I remember it, and all our idiotic clothes and hairstyles. That&#x2019;s what I want you to have, a happy day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly thought for a moment. Every single one of the girls who had been to their house had praised Mother. They had all said she was like a marvelous big sister&#x2014;-you could tell her anything, she always understood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, don&#x2019;t bother. Honestly. It won&#x2019;t <i>be</i> a happy day. There aren&#x2019;t any happy days. Honestly. Days just aren&#x2019;t happy like they were for you, like they are for you. I&#x2019;m not complaining. It&#x2019;s just the way it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She willed her eyes not to fill with tears, she prayed for some understanding to come on her mother&#x2019;s face. What came was a look of great concern, but Dolly knew that it wasn&#x2019;t real understanding. It was just more of the same. Like it had always been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s words washed over her, reassurance, everyone feeling down when they were fifteen, being neither old nor young, more reassurances, soon everything would look rosy again, Dolly&#x2019;s beautiful green eyes would shine again, her lovely thick, shiny hair would fly about her as she raced off, full of excitement about life and all the adventures it held. . .&nbsp;. Dolly sat there glumly as her mother stroked her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked down at Mother&#x2019;s long, thin white fingers with their perfect, long shell--pink nails, she saw Mother&#x2019;s rings, not very huge in themselves but making Mother&#x2019;s little hand seem still frailer by having to bear them. The hand stroked Dolly&#x2019;s square hands, with their bitten nails, their ink stains and the scratches from the blackberry bush.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly knew that the fault was hers, Mother was so good; it was Dolly who was rotten. Rotten and ungiving to her core. Right to the base of her hard, square, unattractive heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Father often looked melancholy, Dolly thought, a little stooped and tired as he walked up the hill from the railway station carrying his briefcase, but as soon as he saw Mother he cheered up. She might wave to him from an upstairs window and then run lightly down the stairs to embrace him when he came in the door. She didn&#x2019;t peck at him; she threw both her arms around him and encircled him, briefcase, overcoat, evening paper and all. Or else she might be in the kitchen, where she would drop everything and run to him. Dolly saw how pleased and even slightly surprised he was each time. He was not given to such spontaneous gestures himself, but he responded like a flower opening to the sun. The worried look of the commuter tired after a day&#x2019;s work disappeared. Mother never laid any problems on him the moment he arrived. If there had been a burst pipe he heard about it later. Much later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so, as Dolly knew would happen, the subject of the sixteenth birthday was raised as an excitement, not a problem. Mother&#x2019;s eyes shone with the excitement of it. A girl turning sixteen&#x2014;-it was a symbol, a landmark, a milestone. It had to be marked. <i>What</i> would they do to make the day marvelous for Dolly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly saw Father&#x2019;s face become tender. Father too must know of other households where the mothers were not as Mother was here. Where there was strife about children having any kind of party. How blessed he was to have the single exception, to have married the only woman in the world who positively relished a celebration for teenage girls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, now.&#x201d; He beamed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lucky girl and there&#x2019;s no doubt about that, Dolly. Well, well, a sixteenth party no less.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind if we can&#x2019;t afford it,&#x201d; Dolly began.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we can afford it. What else do we work for, your mother and I, except to be able to afford the odd little treat like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, Dolly found herself guiltily wondering, Could this possibly be true? Did Father go out that long journey to the faceless office and come back tired every evening so that he could afford birthday parties? Surely not. And Mother, who went to work mornings in a big florist shop, was it all for a nest egg so that they could have these kinds of treats? Dolly had always thought Mother liked being among the beautiful flowers, and having lunch with her friends there and getting tired flowers to take home, where they often came to life again. She thought that Father went to work because it was what men did. They stayed in the office and dealt with files. She realized she must be very stupid about a lot of things. No wonder she couldn&#x2019;t have these great conversations with people, like Mother did. Only the other day she had heard Mother talking to the postman about happiness. Imagine talking about something as huge as happiness to a man who came to deliver the letters. And he had seemed very interested and said that not enough people ever took those kind of things into consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, I&#x2019;m bad at knowing what people like and what they want. You are very good at it. What do <i>you</i> think my friends would like?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly felt about as low as she had ever felt. And who in the world would have an ounce of sympathy for her? A spoiled brat, is what they would say she was. A girl who was being offered everything and could accept nothing. Mother didn&#x2019;t know any of these thoughts. She was too busy being helpful. &#x201c;What about a lunch?&#x201d; she said suddenly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A Saturday lunch at the Grand Hotel&#x2014;-you could all dress up and you could have one bottle of wine between all of you, if you have lots and lots of mineral water. . .&nbsp;. You could order from the menu&nbsp;. . . choose what you like. . .&nbsp;. How about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had definite possibilities. It was so utterly different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you come with us?&#x201d; Dolly asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense, darling, your friends wouldn&#x2019;t want an old fogy like me&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Mother,&#x201d; Dolly begged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mother said that since she would be working on Saturday, well she could wear a silly hat and just drop in and join them for a drink&nbsp;. . . or whatever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly&#x2019;s friends thought it was a great idea. Jenny said she would wear her new outfit and it would make Nick sick as a parrot to know she had been lunching at the Grand. Mary said she&#x2019;d go and grab a look at the menu so they&#x2019;d know what to order. Judy said there might be film scouts there or men who ran model agencies. They said Dolly&#x2019;s mother was a genius...</p></p><h2>The Teeth of the Comb &amp; Other Stories</h2><p><p><strong><strong>Wonderful short stories that sharpen awareness, from a brilliantly gifted Syrian refugee</strong></strong></p><p>Personified animals (snakes, wolves, sheep), natural things (a swamp, a lake, a rainbow, trees), mankind&#x2019;s creations (trucks, swords, zeroes) are all characters in&nbsp;<em>The Teeth of the Comb</em>. They aspire, they plot, they hope, they destroy, they fail, they love. These wonderful small stories animate new realities and make us see our reality anew. Reading Alomar&#x2019;s sly moral fables and sharp political allegories, the reader always sits up a little straighter, and a little wiser. Here is the title story:</p><p><em>Some of the teeth of the comb were envious of the class differences that exist between humans. They strived desperately to increase their height, and, when they succeeded, began to look with disdain on their colleagues below.</em></p><p><em>After a little while the comb&#x2019;s owner felt a desire to comb his hair. But when he found the comb in this state he threw it in the garbage.</em></p></p><p><p><strong>Osama Alomar</strong> was born in Damascus, Syria in 1968 and now lives in Chicago. A poet, short-story writer, and musician, Alomar is the author of three collections of short stories and a volume of poetry. He is a regular contributor to various newspapers and journals within the Arab world.</p><p><strong>C. J. Collins</strong> is a librarian and a translator based in Queens, NY.</p>&#x201c;Alomar&#x2019;s sly moral fables and sharp political allegories are shrewd and full of intelligence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rabeea Saleem, <em>Chicago Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Elegant, often elegiac sketches by Syrian-born writer Alomar, now a resident of Chicago.&#x201c;He was born with a silver knife in his mouth. And he was its first victim.&#x201d; Thus, in its entirety, one of Alomar&#x2019;s short stories, this one with the simple title &#x201c;The Knife.&#x201d; Others stretch out to a page, a few others a little more than that, but all are masterpieces of compression, presented with the generally unironic matter-of-factness of a fable that, no matter how improbable the circumstances, behaves perfectly well according to its own logic: that knife could be literal just as easily as metaphorical, considering the violence and mayhem of the world. The title story is a sly allegory about the human desire for&#x2015;well, for better circumstances than most of us enjoy, anyway, the teeth of the comb standing for aspirations that, even when fulfilled, do not go unpunished. Occasionally Alomar goes full-tilt for the classical fable, letting animals and sometimes even plants stand in for human beings; when humans and the natural world meet, it is seldom to our credit, as when an ear of wheat beholds a throng of human ears on heads that &#x201c;were bent before their tyrant leader&#x201d; and mistakes their posture for a boon. No good deed goes unpunished, indeed; in one fable worthy of Kafka, a writer is made to sit on his pen in torture, and his blood turns blue in the bargain. &#x201c;He became prominent...and slowly came to his senses,&#x201d; Alomar writes, leaving us to guess whether the writer became complicit in the regime that afflicted him or came to his senses in some other way, pleasant or horrific.Swamps and streams, lightning and dogs all play a part in these beguiling, suggestive fables. The stories are of perfect length, but one wishes the book went on for much longer.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Alomar's work speaks to the power that words can have when they&#x2019;re constrained, be it by style or by necessity... a master of the form.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bradley Babendir, <em>New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There are no wasted words in Alomar&#x2019;s beautiful collection of very short fictions. Philosophical and subversive, these tiny parables deconstruct human failings with a keen insight. The title story, an anecdote about the uneven teeth of a comb, reveals a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of social stratification. &#x201c;Love Letter&#x201d; tells the story of a couple separated by class, culture, and distance both metaphorical and physical. The nameless narrator emigrates during an era of oppression, mirroring Alomar&#x2019;s exile from Syria. The lovers continue a written correspondence, but, as revolution and civil war divide their homeland, chaos threatens to sever the pair forever. In &#x201c;The Shining Idea,&#x201d; a cynical father debates with his optimistic son about the inherent darkness of humanity. &#x201c;The world is a blank page,&#x201d; the boy explains. The collection delves into universal themes of aging&#x2015;&#x201c;Journey of Life&#x201d;&#x2015;and love and loss. These stories deliver the kind of stunning maxims that a cunning master might spout to an eagerly waiting acolyte. By working together with C.J. Collins on the translation, the author succeeds in highlighting the inherent poetics of his prose....Alomar&#x2019;s work swims in the aspects of the modern world that do not make sense upon closer inspection, like the correlations between poverty and capitalism. These brief narratives are not nihilistic; they convey a plea for progress and improvement. Alomar&#x2019;s writing brims with hope, and this slim volume is full of compassion and depth.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Alomar's stories are alternatively hilarious, portentous and utterly poetic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ben Tripp, <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the Arab world, the Syrian writer Osama Alomar has a growing reputation as the author of short, clever parables that comment obliquely on political and social issues. But here in Chicago, where he has lived in exile since 2008, he spends most of his time as the driver of Car 45 at the Horizon Taxi Cab company.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Larry Rohter, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In Alomar&#x2019;s stories, fantasy never devolves into mere whimsy. His magical imaginative creations are, every one, inspired by his deeply felt philosophical, moral, and political convictions, giving these tales a heartfelt urgency.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lydia Davis, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Despite their apparent playful wit, Alomar&#x2019;s deceptively slight short stories have teeth and bite. In spare, accessible prose, one encounters the painful and bitter poetry of exile running like a blood-red thread through this slim but dense collection.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Yahia Lababidi, <em>World Literature Today</em></strong></p><h2>Investigative Psychology: Offender Profiling and the Analysis of Criminal Action</h2><p>This ground-breaking text is the first to provide a detailed overview of Investigative Psychology, from the earliest work through to recent studies, including descriptions of previously unpublished internal reports.

Indeed, certain traditional topics are given somewhat condensed treatment to allow room for a survey of more recent advances.<br>The book is divided into four major sections. <i>Part I </i>deals with the principles of quantum statistical mechanics and includes discussions of energy levels, states and eigenfunctions, degeneracy and other topics. <i>Part II </i>examines systems composed of independent molecules or of other independent subsystems. Topics range from ideal monatomic gas and monatomic crystals to polyatomic gas and configuration of polymer molecules and rubber elasticity. An examination of systems of interacting molecules comprises the nine chapters in <i>Part Ill, </i>reviewing such subjects as lattice statistics, imperfect gases and dilute liquid solutions. <i>Part IV </i>covers quantum statistics and includes sections on Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, photon gas and free-volume theories of quantum liquids.<br>Each chapter includes problems varying in difficulty &#x2014; ranging from simple numerical exercises to small-scale "research" propositions. In addition, supplementary reading lists for each chapter invite students to pursue the subject at a more advanced level. Readers are assumed to have studied thermodynamics, calculus, elementary differential equations and elementary quantum mechanics.<br>Because of the flexibility of the chapter arrangements, this book especially lends itself to use in a one-or two-semester graduate course in chemistry, a one-semester senior or graduate course in physics or an introductory course in statistical mechanics.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Planning and Administering Early Childhood Programs</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p> <p> </p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

Used by home schoolers and charter, public and private school students world-wide for over ten years, Friendly Chemistry presents what is often considered an intimidating subject as a genuinely fun, enjoyable experience. Whether you&#39;re a high-school aged student needing a lab science course or a &#34;non-traditional&#34; student looking for a refresher course to help you prepare for an upcoming entrance exam, Friendly Chemistry can help you accomplish your goal in a &#34;painless&#34; way! If you do have aspirations of a future in a science field, Friendly Chemistry can give you the solid foundation you need to succeed in subsequent courses. Friendly Chemistry was written using simple language and a host of analogies to make learning (and teaching!) chemistry easy. The chemistry concepts presented in Friendly Chemistry are NOT watered-down. The concepts are just explained in ways that are readily understood by most learners. Coupled with these explanations is a host of teaching aids, labs and games which makes the learning concrete and multi-sensory. Students find the course fun and painless. Parents often comment, &#34;I wish I had had this when I was taking chemistry. Now it all makes so much sense!&#34; Friendly Chemistry covers the same topics taught in traditional high school chemistry courses. The course begins with an introduction to atomic theory followed by discussion of why the elements are arranged the way they are in the periodic table. Quantum mechanics comes next using the acclaimed &#34;Doo-wop&#34; Board as a teaching aid. Next comes a discussion of how atoms become charged (ionization), followed by an explanation of how charged atoms make compounds. The mole is introduced next, followed by a discussion of chemical reactions. Stoichiometry (predicting amounts of product produced from a reaction) is treated next followed by a discussion of solutions (molarity). The course is wrapped up with a discussion of the ideal gas laws. Please note that this is Volume 1 of the Teacher&#39;s Edition intended for use with one student. Volume 2 of the Teacher&#39;s Edition (One Student), the Student Edition and the Manipulative Set must be purchased separately to have all necessary materials to complete this course.

Teaching students how to solve analogies not only develops their logical thinking, but also builds visual awareness and verbal proficiency.<br><br>The seven different types of visual analogies and 14 different verbal analogies in <i>Analogies for Beginners</i> are perfect for beginning lessons in logical reasoning, flexible thinking, and vocabulary. Each page gives students an example of the type of analogy that is being introduced and then provides 7 (visual) or 10 (verbal) problems for them to solve. This combination of verbal and visual formats is an ideal way to introduce logical thinking in primary grades. Whether you have time for one analogy a day, or a worksheet a week, students will benefit in many ways when analogies are part of your curriculum. The use of visual analogies is beneficial for developing visual analysis even for older students, but especially useful for nonreaders and students with developing English skills. The verbal analogies provide students with exercises that require them to use word comprehension and also to examine various characteristics, uses, and relationships.</p><p>Lynne Chatham holds both a bachelor's degree in education with a major in mathematics and a master's degree in curriculum and instruction.

GENTRY, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, USA * `The thoroughly-revised second edition of A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar is without doubt the new gold standard for students and scholars of Biblical Hebrew. Its clear format, accessible prose and comprehensive coverage belie a great deal of linguistic sophistication, though the authors wear their scholarship lightly. They successfully draw from the diversity of contemporary approaches to the study of language - functionalist, formalist, cognitive, typological - yet keep the phenomena of the language itself &#34;front and centre&#34;, making this grammar user-friendly without any loss of complexity.&#39; * MATTHEW ANSTEY, Charles Sturt University School of Theology, Australia * Christo van der Merwe and Jacobus Naude&#39;s new edition of A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar is fully conversant in contemporary linguistics and grounded in the authors&#39; deep, intricate knowledge of the language data. Their work needs to be on the digital shelf of anyone studying the Hebrew Bible or biblical languages. This is arguably the most important grammar of Hebrew to be published in several decades. * Michael Aubrey, Linguist, Editor of Koine-Greek.com *</p><h2>Trimalchio: An Early Version of &#39;The Great Gatsby&#39; (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of F.

Fitzgerald wrote the novel as Trimalchio and submitted it to Maxwell Perkins, his editor at Scribner&#39;s, who had the novel set in type and sent the galleys to Fitzgerald in France. Fitzgerald then virtually rewrote the novel in galleys, producing the book we know as The Great Gatsby. This first version, Trimalchio, has never been published and has only been read by a handful of people. It is markedly different from The Great Gatsby: two chapters were completely rewritten for the published novel, and the rest of the book was heavily revised. Characterization is different, the narrative voice of Nick Carraway is altered and, most importantly, the revelation of Jay Gatsby&#39;s past is handled in a wholly different way. James L.W.

This book will help you embrace God as your Father and see yourself as a son/daughter of God. In other words, it will help you hear what God is communicating to His people at this time. The concept of God as Father sounds simple enough, but the related truths are clouded by 2,000 years of Christianity being filtered through the lens of Western civilization. In Father-Son Theology, I have worked passionately to separate biblical Christianity from Western culture. That means: 1. separating Christianity from the dualism that lies at the foundation of Western civilization; 2. eliminating the influence of Plato that came into the Church primarily through Augustine and Calvin; 3. and embracing the Biblical/Hebraic concept of God. In Father-Son Theology, I take a stand on several major issues, challenging doctrines that Christians have accepted as truth, without taking the time to consider the historical development of the related doctrines. Just one example of a false doctrine that developed as a result of mixing the hedonistic philosophy of Plato with Christianity is the doctrine that God is so holy that He must separate Himself from sin and sinful people. This false doctrine came into Christianity during the fourth century and has led to a historic misunderstanding of what happened when Adam sinned and what happened when Jesus died on the cross. There was no gap of eternity created between God and man when Adam sinned in the Garden. Nor did Father-God separate Himself from Jesus when He hung on the cross and became sin for us. There is nothing in the nature of God that makes Him separate Himself from sinners. The best, most perfect, example of holiness that we have is Jesus Christ, and He did not separate Himself from sinners. In fact, He hung around them. In order to understand God s holiness we must relate it to His love--which causes Him to pursue sinners, not separate Himself. There are other fundamental misunderstandings within Western Christianity that have profound implications on everything we believe. They distort our view of God. The Western Christianity that we have been indoctrinated into robs us of the supernatural dimension inherent in biblical Christianity. It distances us from the Kingdom of God. It yields a form of godliness that denies the power.</p><p></p><h2>Sacred Earth Celebrations, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p><em>Sacred Earth Celebrations</em> is the revised and updated version of Glennie Kindred&#x2019;s bestselling, classic book,<em> Sacred Celebrations</em>.

Casualty lists reached unimagined proportions as the same ground -- places like Ypres and the Somme -- was fought over again and again. Other major bloody battles remain vivid in memory to this day: Gallipoli and the Battle of Jutland are but two examples.

Professor Stokesbury analyzes these technological innovations and the war's complex military campaigns in lucid detail.

It had sat in the box for a week, waiting for her, he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have sent it along, but nobody was going out your way. I figured you&#x2019;d be in for the oranges. I set two aside for you, the best two.&#x201d; The man operated the post office out of his general store.</p> <p>The oranges were the reason Eliza had hitched old Sabra to the wagon and driven into town. She had a sack of corn in the back to trade, a steep price for two oranges, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. There were no coins to be spent. Will had promised to send her his thirteen dollars a month pay, but so far, she&#x2019;d received nothing.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Will, is it not?&#x201d; the postmaster asked, fingering the letter as if it were his own.</p> <p>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; Eliza snatched the missive, as if she feared the man would open and read it himself. Perhaps he had already, for the letter was not sealed with wax but merely folded into itself, forming its own envelope.</p> <p>But the postmaster didn&#x2019;t comment on the contents. &#x201c;A nice Christmas present for you, then. I&#x2019;ll fetch them oranges.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza nodded. The oranges were likely not the best ones at all but the culls, dull orange in color, shriveled, the juice half gone. But they were oranges, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be Christmas without them. She had told the children there might not be oranges this year, what with the war. After all, oranges came from somewhere in the South, so maybe the storekeeper wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get them. Davy and Luzena had said they understood, but she knew they would be disappointed. They had always had oranges at Christmas. When they were younger, Davy and Luzena would consume the fruit all at once, letting the juice run down their fingers, but now that they were older, they carefully savored each section so that the orange lasted the entire Christmas day. And they saved the peels for their mother to dry, then chop up for her cooking. Once Davy had cut his orange in half and scraped out the pulp with his teeth. Then he had fastened each half of the cleaned orange to the bottom of a bottle, where it dried hard into a cup. He&#x2019;d hidden the cups a whole year, until the following Christmas, giving one to Luzena, the other to Eliza, who used it for her pins.</p> <p>This year they would have the Christmas oranges after all, along with the divinity candy that Eliza had set aside when she made the batch for Will, had secreted it in a tin for a surprise. She would stew the rooster she had killed that morning and add potatoes and onions, mix in a few herbs she had collected and dried in the summer. And then she would surprise the children with the presents&#x2014;a knife for Davy that Will had found on the road just before he left. Eliza had rubbed the rust from the knife, then polished it until it looked almost new. And there was a wooden doll for Luzena, although she was nearly too old for such a plaything. Will had carved the doll before he left for a soldier, and had given it to Eliza to hide. She&#x2019;d made an indigo dress for the doll and wrapped it in a tiny quilt made from scraps left over from the Stars and Stripes quilt. Now, best of all, there would be Will&#x2019;s letter to read. She wouldn&#x2019;t open the letter until Christmas morning. They would read it before church.</p> <p>As she left the store, the letter and the oranges safe in her basket, Eliza scanned the sky, thinking the three of them might not make it to church at all. The snow had threatened even before she set out for town, and she had worried that it might come quickly and make the driving difficult. But a snowstorm would not have kept her from the Christmas oranges.</p> <p>The snow was coming fast, in flakes as big and as soft as the down in Will&#x2019;s Christmas quilt. As she hurried to the wagon, Eliza wondered if he had received it. She smiled to think that Will would spend the night before Christmas wrapped in the down-filled quilt she had made for him. She wondered if he would rub his hand against his name and hers and know how much she had loved stitching them, how much she loved him. She climbed into the wagon and flicked the reins against Sabra&#x2019;s back, and the horse started up, taking a quick step or two before settling into a walk. The horse was old, and Eliza was grateful the mare could pull the wagon at all.</p> <p>As she slapped the reins against Sabra&#x2019;s back a second time, she heard someone shout, &#x201c;Eliza!&#x201d; and reined in the horse. She turned to the voice, unsure in the snow who was speaking to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Missouri Ann Stark,&#x201d; a young woman said, emerging from the store and coming up to the wagon. &#x201c;I saw you in the post office. I guess you didn&#x2019;t see me.&#x201d; Missouri Ann was small and pretty, with green eyes and hair so pale it was almost the white of the snow. But her face was gray and gaunt.</p> <p>&#x201c;I ask you to forgive me. There was a letter from Will, and for just about a minute, I forgot where I was.&#x201d; Eliza saw that her friend was clutching her own envelope. &#x201c;Did you hear from Hugh, too? That would make Christmas all the better if we both got letters.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann shook her head. &#x201c;Hugh can&#x2019;t write. Couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza stared at the woman. &#x201c;What do you mean, <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, Eliza, Hugh&#x2019;s dead. I&#x2019;m a widow woman.&#x201d; She stopped, as if studying the words, and repeated them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a widow woman. I don&#x2019;t have a husband no more.&#x201d; She rubbed her shawl across her face, then steadied herself. &#x201c;It says right here in this letter that Hugh&#x2019;s killed hisself in the battle. They&#x2019;s wrote he died. Here, I&#x2019;ll read it to you. &#x2018;Missus Stark, your husband was perfectly resigned to dying. His final words were, &#x201c;I die for a worthy cause.&#x201d; He died a-praising the Union and said for you not to worry because he was going to a better place.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you believe it?&#x201d; Eliza blurted out. She shouldn&#x2019;t have asked such a thing, but those were not words Hugh Stark would have spoken. More likely in his final moments, he would have profaned the Lord as well as the Union Army for playing such a rotten trick on him as to let him pass over.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, but it&#x2019;s nice they wrote it.&#x201d; She looked up, her face damp, but whether the wetness came from tears or snow Eliza didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;Oh, Eliza, what&#x2019;s to become of us?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Missouri Ann. It isn&#x2019;t fair the war&#x2019;s taken our men. I suppose you and Nance will stay on with the Starks.&#x201d; Eliza didn&#x2019;t like the Starks. They were loud and foulmouthed and lived like hogs. Hugh&#x2019;s brothers were too unpatriotic or too cowardly to join the army. After they married, Hugh and Missouri Ann had gone to housekeeping on their own place, but when Hugh joined up, he moved his wife and daughter in with his family. Eliza had called on her friend only once at the Stark farm, because she could sense Missouri Ann&#x2019;s embarrassment at the way her husband&#x2019;s family lived. They were lazy and stupid, without sense enough to put butter on bread. Eliza couldn&#x2019;t think how they kept themselves, because nothing ever hatched on their farm.</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m between a hawk and a buzzard. They won&#x2019;t let me go, but I can&#x2019;t stay. They treat me like chicken scratch, and with Hugh dead, his brothers likely&nbsp;&#x2026; Only thing protected me was they knew Hugh&#x2019;d womp them if they didn&#x2019;t treat me right.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re family. And surely they dote on Nance.&#x201d; Missouri Ann&#x2019;s daughter was not quite two. She was a pretty thing, with fine golden hair and hazel eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice. Only Mother Stark does. The men blame me she&#x2019;s not a boy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll go back to your own people, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. When I married Hugh, my folks said I couldn&#x2019;t never come home again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But they didn&#x2019;t mean it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They did, all right. They wouldn&#x2019;t take me in if it was snowing ice cakes and I was dressed naked.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza understood. Missouri Ann&#x2019;s family was as judgmental as the Starks were mean.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, Eliza, I thought about it, &#x2019;course, thought what I&#x2019;d do if Hugh got killed in the war, but never did I come up with a plan.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza got out of the wagon and put her arms around Missouri Ann. &#x201c;Do you have to tell the Starks that Hugh&#x2019;s dead? You could wait until you&#x2019;ve found a place for you and Nance.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d thought of that. But I told the postmaster what was in the letter, and you know how you can&#x2019;t never trust him to keep a secret. Besides, Dad Stark gets the paper from Topeka every week where it lists the dead. He has me read it to him, for he can&#x2019;t read, neither. And how am I going to just skip over Hugh&#x2019;s name if it&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann tucked the letter into the bosom of her dress and wiped her face with her hands. &#x201c;I guess I should be mourning Hugh instead of worrying about me and Nance, but I can&#x2019;t help it. I got to think of us first. Mourning&#x2019;s for rich folks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Have you prayed?&#x201d; Eliza said, and immediately regretted the words. When would Missouri Ann have prayed? She&#x2019;d just received the letter. Besides, Missouri Ann hadn&#x2019;t been in church for a long time. She wasn&#x2019;t a praying woman.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me and the Lord ain&#x2019;t too acquainted of late.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe not, but surely someone at the church would find a place for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe you forgot Nance came awful early, and there&#x2019;s some that holds it against me, believes me to be a prodigal woman.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza did remember now, but the gossiping had been more about Missouri Ann fornicating with a Stark than about the early arrival of the baby. The baby had been the only explanation Eliza could think of for why Missouri Ann, that sweet girl, had married Hugh. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to have a briar-patch child, a bastard.</p> <p>Missouri Ann looked Eliza square in the face and said, &#x201c;I could come live with you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</p> <p>The new widow had been holding her breath, and now she said in a rush, &#x201c;You got that hired man&#x2019;s soddy out back of your house. I could work around the place to pay for lodging. And Nance won&#x2019;t be no trouble. We wouldn&#x2019;t be a burden to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a ramshackle house with a hole in the wall where the snow drifts in. That&#x2019;s no fit place for a woman and child.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a good fixer. You should have seen me at the Stark place, nailing up boards. I wanted it warm for Nance. I asked the boys, but they&#x2019;re lazy as summer rain. They don&#x2019;t do nothing and don&#x2019;t start that till after dinner. The roof on that cabin is awful bad, and Mother Stark complained the rain was coming in on her bed and asked them to do something about it. So they went upstairs and moved the bed. That&#x2019;s all the good they are, and her their mother, birthing and raising them. She was the only decent one in the lot.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza laughed despite herself. She wondered again why Missouri Ann had married into such a family, why she&#x2019;d fallen in love with Hugh Stark. Maybe it had been his good looks and the slow way he smiled. He&#x2019;d seemed truly taken with Missouri Ann, however, and might have been a better man than she&#x2019;d given him credit for, although she wasn&#x2019;t sure. And then she remembered that Hugh Stark&#x2019;s widow was standing in front of her. &#x201c;He was a good husband. I&#x2019;m sorry about Hugh, Missouri Ann. Truly I am.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann looked away. &#x201c;Like I say, I can&#x2019;t think about that now. I got to ponder what I&#x2019;m going to do. I best have plans before the Starks find out about Hugh. They might expect me to marry Edison.&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman had said that last in such a low voice that Eliza had strained to hear her, and even then, she wasn&#x2019;t sure she had heard right. &#x201c;Marry Edison? Edison Stark? Hugh&#x2019;s brother?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The same.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One-legged Edison?&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;But why would you do that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It might be I won&#x2019;t have a choice. You don&#x2019;t know the Starks, Eliza. Mother Stark said if anything happened to Hugh, I&#x2019;d best get away fast, or it might be I&#x2019;d never get another chance. She said it was too late for her, too late by thirty years, but I still had time. The Starks don&#x2019;t want me, but they won&#x2019;t let me go, neither.&#x201d;</p> <p>Had Hugh been like the rest of them? Eliza wondered. Had the sins of his father passed on to him? But Missouri Ann cared for him, so maybe he was different.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hugh was the best of them,&#x201d; Missouri Ann said, as if she knew what Eliza was thinking. &#x201c;He was a good man. I&#x2019;ll raise Nance to think well of her father.&#x201d; Then she added, &#x201c;Maybe I could stay with old Aunt Grace. She needs someone to have a care for her.&#x201d;</p> <p>Old Aunt Grace was a slattern who lived in a shack in the woods and trapped wild animals, eating their flesh and selling their skins.</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Eliza said, horrified. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll move in with us.&#x201d; She said it quickly, without much thought, but now she realized she had no choice but to take in Missouri Ann and Nance. What if Will had been killed and she and the children had had to leave the farm? Where would they have gone? &#x201c;We would welcome you and Nance, Missouri Ann.&#x201d;</p> <p>Missouri Ann stared at Eliza. &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;</p> <p>Eliza said they would go and get Missouri Ann&#x2019;s things right then, before the storm got worse.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll have to sneak away. I&#x2019;ll walk to your place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;In this snow?&#x201d; Eliza thought a moment, then said they could meet at church the following day.</p> <p>Missouri Ann frowned. &#x201c;Starks don&#x2019;t go to church, even at Christmas.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then you must tell them you are going to church for Nance&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Eliza said. &#x201c;What about your belongings?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t got any,&#x201d; Missouri Ann said.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>As she rode behind the slow horse back to the farm, Eliza wondered what had happened to her friend in the past few years. She&#x2019;d been shocked, of course, when Missouri Ann married Hugh Stark. He was a comely man with a smile that would have melted ice in midwinter, but there had been something about him that Eliza feared. Missouri Ann had been raised by a family of holy willies whose only joy was pointing out the sins of others. Eliza&#x2019;s friend knew from an early age she was going to hell, so what did it matter if she broke a few of God&#x2019;s laws, especially the one about fornication? But with a Stark! Missouri Ann was guileless and good. She could have done better. And then to be dumped at the Stark shanty when Hugh went off to war! Missouri Ann was a tough girl, but she had grown depressed, beaten down in the last months. Well, who wouldn&#x2019;t be, living with a family like that? Eliza chided herself for not having been a better friend. Then she wondered if Missouri Ann had any friends at all or whether, like Eliza, they&#x2019;d been discouraged from visiting.</p> <p>Of course Eliza would let Missouri Ann and Nance live at the Spooner farm. She wondered that she had hesitated at all. Things would be tight. They would all have to be careful to make the food last through the winter. The harvest had been all right, although even with the help of men working on shares, they had had to leave some of the crops to rot. Eliza had tried to persuade Will to wait to join up until after the harvest was over, but he was anxious to kill the Rebels. He&#x2019;d said she could manage, and she had, although not as well as if he&#x2019;d been there.</p> <p>Even if Hugh&#x2019;s pay came through, there would be little money for necessities and none for extravagances such as more oranges. It was doubtful Missouri Ann would bring so much as a penny with her. But they would make it. Having another woman living on the place might help the loneliness she had felt since Will enlisted. And Eliza and the children would be safer with another adult there. She&#x2019;d worried about safety ever since Davy found that tramp in the barn.</p> <p>The cold had begun to seep into Eliza&#x2019;s bones, and she tried to hurry the horse, but Sabra couldn&#x2019;t be persuaded to pick up speed. Eliza hoped the Stark horse was faster, because she didn&#x2019;t like to think about baby Nance out in the cold. She had glimpsed the child peering out of the window ...</p></p><h2>Please See Us</h2><p><b>In this sophisticated, suspenseful debut reminiscent of Laura Lippman and Chloe Benjamin, two young women become unlikely friends during one fateful summer in Atlantic City as mysterious disappearances hit dangerously close to home.</b><br><br>Summer has come to Atlantic City but the boardwalk is empty of tourists, the casino lights have dimmed, and two Jane Does are laid out in the marshland behind the Sunset Motel, just west of town.

This book contains a selection of inspiring stories from ordinary people who have had extraordinary experiences that have changed the course and direction of their lives and opened each and every one of them to the power of divine love.&nbsp;<br><br>Recent years have seen a dramatic change of attitude towards NDEs. Unfortunately, the ongoing debates about NDEs have detracted greatly from the very important transformational effects that NDEs have and how empowering they can be for the whole of mankind. The NDE instils knowledge in those who experience it that we are all interconnected and part of one great whole.<br><br>This book aims to inspire people from all walks of life, creeds, cultures and faiths to the transformational power of the message of NDEs and show how the love experienced during the NDE has the capacity to heal minds, bodies and souls.</p><p>Dr Penny Sartori PhD, RGN is an expert in NDEs, having been an intensive care nurse for 17 years and having undertaken the UK&#x2019;s first long-term prospective study on them, for which she was awarded a PhD. She wrote the bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences</i>&nbsp;(2014), which was serialised in the&nbsp;<i>Daily Mail</i>, and she lectures both nationally and internationally. She currently teaches at Swansea University.<br><br>Kelly Walsh is the founder of the Positivity Power Movement and Love Care Share charitable foundation. Her life&#x2019;s work has been inspired by an NDE she had in 2009 following a suicide attempt and subsequent spiritual experiences she has had since.Extraordinary transformation results from NDEs in the lives of the experiencers themselves, and this book explores many such life-changing stories in a most revealing fashion. One of its greatest gifts is its comforting portrayal of the infinite healing power of love, and the sense of connectedness with the universe that arises from such profound experiences. Science is on the cusp of a major awakening as NDEs and similar spiritually transformative experiences demand more complete explanations, all opening the door to a more meaningful understanding of the nature of consciousness, and of all of existence.<br><br>--Eben Alexander MD, Neurosurgeon and author of&nbsp;<i>Proof of Heaven</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Map of Heaven<br><br></i>The book can do more to release humanity from its fear of dying than any book in recent memory.<i><br> &nbsp;<br> --Neale Donald Walsch, International bestselling author<br></i><br><br>An enthralling read that encapsulates the positive impact Near Death experiences are having on people and the wider world. The work done by Penny Sartori and Kelly Walsh truly reinforces the important message that we are all one, all connected and that love is the most powerful source in the universe capable of healing the world.&nbsp; I highly recommend this well written and thought provoking book.

Many kept diaries and wrote letters home: from an English nurse who had already survived the sinking of the Titanic; to the black valet of the US Ambassador, far from his native Deep South; to suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, who had come to Petrograd to inspect the indomitable Women&#x2019;s Death Battalion led by Maria Bochkareva.</p><p>Helen Rappaport draws upon this rich trove of material, much of it previously unpublished, to carry us right up to the action &#x2013; to see, feel and hear the Revolution as it happened to an assortment of individuals who suddenly felt themselves trapped in a "red madhouse."</p></p><p>HELEN RAPPAPORT is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Romanov Sisters</i>.

The first concerns redemptive history and the kingdom of God. The New Testament writers adopt the Old Testament vision of God's reign and affirm that it has come in Jesus Christ, although final fulfillment is yet to come. Second, the ultimate goal of the kingdom is God's glory. Schreiner goes on to relate these themes to the life of the believer and the community of faith. <br><br>Pastors and students will find this a comprehensive and illuminating survey of the unifying themes found throughout the New Testament.</p><p>While none of the New Testament documents claims to provide a "theology" on its own, Thomas Schreiner suggests that certain recurring themes emerge from the study of the whole. In this volume, he traces key themes as they appear throughout the New Testament canon, exploring the emphases that emerge from a detailed reading of the texts.<br><br>"Lucid, incisive, and above all devoted to listening to the text of the New Testament, Tom Schreiner's volume is like a cool drink in a postmodern desert. Schreiner unfolds the richness of New Testament theology through the lens of salvation history, showing how fruitful the promise-fulfillment, already-not yet paradigm is for understanding the New Testament. If you want a New Testament theology that is informed, exegetically grounded, canonically based, Trinitarian, and written from the standpoint of a sturdy faith, then this is the book for you!"--<b>Donald A. Hagner</b>, George Eldon Ladd Professor Emeritus of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"A magnificent achievement! Schreiner has combined the breadth and depth of his knowledge of the New Testament with extensive discussion of the scholarly literature. Best of all, it follows the New Testament in testifying to the majesty and glory of God."--<b>Simon J. Gathercole</b>, lecturer in New Testament studies, University of Cambridge<br><br>"Tom Schreiner's <i>New Testament Theology </i>is a valuable addition to the field, providing to students the kind of overview that only a seasoned scholar can produce. The volume is particularly significant for taking a more thematic approach than have most other New Testament theologies. Schreiner therefore comes closer than most others to giving us a genuine New Testament 'theology' (rather than New Testament 'theologies')."--<b>Douglas J. Moo</b>, Blanchard Professor of New Testament, Wheaton College<br><br>"Thomas Schreiner is known for being a skillful and careful New Testament scholar. In his <i>New Testament Theology</i> his abilities and his clear, concise style are on full display as he gives us a synthetic account of this complex subject, an account that reflects his high view of Scripture. This is probably the best New Testament theology written in the last several decades from a decidedly Reformed and evangelical point of view. While I disagree with the analysis at various points, it is still a fine piece of work, and I am happy to commend it."--<b>Ben Witherington III</b>, professor of New Testament, Asbury Theological Seminary"Scholars frequently focus so tightly on the details of the New Testament documents that they miss the big picture. On the other hand, all too often attempts to summarize the message of the New Testament ignore the particular expressions and diverse emphases of its twenty-seven books. Without losing the trees for the wood, Schreiner's <i>New Testament Theology </i>offers a superb exposition of the New Testament's central message, the glory of God in Christ. Pastors and students will find it an invaluable resource for answering the question most readers are asking: what is the New Testament about?"--<b>Brian S. Rosner</b>, senior lecturer in New Testament and ethics, Moore Theological College<br><br>"Schreiner's <i>New Testament Theology</i> has long been awaited by colleagues, friends, and students. The appendix, which provides a helpful survey of the discipline of New Testament theology, and the discussion of justification, which contains a summary of the modern debate and a defense of a forensic interpretation of the Pauline teaching, are alone worth the price of the book."--<b>Robert H. Stein</b>, senior professor of New Testament interpretation, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>In <i>New Testament Theology</i>, Thomas Schreiner's approach is based on solid exegesis of all the key texts, which leads him to a unified view of core New Testament teaching. He focuses particularly on two overarching themes. The first concerns the unity of redemptive history and the kingdom of God. The New Testament takes up Old Testament imagery and affirms that the kingdom has come (although it remains unfulfilled) in Jesus Christ. The second related theme concerns the goal of the kingdom--the glory of God through the work of Christ and the empowering presence of the Spirit. In the second half of the work, Schreiner takes up the question of what these themes mean for the life of the believer and the ministry of the community of faith.<br><br>Although this substantial and comprehensive volume will be of great interest to scholars, Schreiner's first concern is to provide an accessible guide for students and pastors. He has succeeded admirably, and readers will find here a lucid exposition of the theology of the New Testament.</p><h2>The Republic of Imagination: A Life in Books</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>bestseller<br><br>The author of the beloved #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> returns with the next chapter of her life in books&#x2014;a passionate and deeply moving hymn to America</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Ten years ago, Azar Nafisi electrified readers with her multimillion-copy bestseller&nbsp;<i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i>, which told the story of how, against the backdrop of morality squads and executions, she taught&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>&nbsp;and other classics of English and American literature to her eager students in Iran.

She lives in Washington, D.C.<p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>A few years ago I was in Seattle signing books at a marvelous independent bookstore called Elliott Bay when I noticed a young man standing by the table, watching me. When the line had dwindled, he finally addressed me. He said he was passing through Seattle, visiting a friend, and he wanted me to know he had lived in Iran until recently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s useless,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;your talk about books. These people are different from us&#x2014;they&#x2019;re from another world. They don&#x2019;t care about books and such things. It&#x2019;s not like Iran, where we were crazy enough to xerox hundreds of pages of books like <i>Madame Bovary</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I had time to think of a response, he went on to tell me about the first time he had been arrested, late at night during one of the usual random car searches by the revolutionary militia. He had been taken into custody with his two friends, more for their insolence than for the contraband tapes found in the car. They were kept for forty-eight hours and then released without explanation, after being fined and flogged. There was no denying that a normal day in the life of a young Iranian is very different from that of most young Americans.</p><p>I had heard such stories many times before, but there was something unusual about this young man. He spoke in a casual tone that made what he said all the more poignant, as if he were trying to negate the event by describing it in a nonchalant manner. He said that during the floggings, it was not just the pain but the humiliation that had made him feel for a few moments as if he were leaving his body and becoming a ghost, watching himself being flogged from a distance. &#x201c;It made it easier,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;as a ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It was a good survival technique.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It still is,&#x201d; he said, with his knowing smile.</p><p>By now there was a line again, patiently and politely waiting, and I made a silly remark to the effect that perhaps America was a land of ghosts anyway. He did not react to that. Instead he handed me a Post-it note and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a book. This is for a friend.&#x201d;</p><p>I signed my name on that orange Post-it and gingerly handed him my card. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be in touch,&#x201d; I said. He took both the Post-it and the card and of course he never did get in touch. But I never lost track of him completely, because that young man, with his serene smile and his words, revisits me<i> </i>in strange places and seemingly unrelated encounters. He has stayed with me partly because I felt then, as I do now, that I had disappointed him&#x2014;something was expected of me that was not fulfilled. When I realized he was going to haunt me for the foreseeable future, I decided to give him a name: Ramin, in honor of another young man I had known in Iran who told me about a similar experience. All these ghosts&#x2014;how do we fulfill our responsibilities toward them?</p><p>Thinking over what Ramin had said, I found it intriguing that he had suggested not that Americans did not understand <i>our </i>books but that they didn&#x2019;t understand their own. In an oblique way, he had made it seem as if Western literature belonged more to the hankering souls of the Islamic Republic of Iran than to the inhabitants of the land that had given birth to them. How could this be? And yet it is true that people who brave censorship, jail and torture to gain access to books or music or movies or works of art tend to hold the whole enterprise in an entirely different light.</p><p>&#x201c;These people,&#x201d; he had said with his inscrutable smile, &#x201c;are different from us. They don&#x2019;t care about books and such things.&#x201d; Every once in a while, after a talk, during a book signing or over coffee with an old friend, this point will come up, usually as a question: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think that literature and books were so important in Iran because there was so much repression there? And don&#x2019;t you think that in a democracy there is no such urgent need for them?&#x201d;</p><p>My impulse now, as then, is to disagree. The majority of people in this country who haunt bookstores, go to readings and book festivals or simply read in the privacy of their homes are not traumatized exiles. Many have seldom left their hometown or state, but does this mean that they do not dream, that they have no fears, that they don&#x2019;t feel pain and anguish and yearn for a life of meaning? Stories are not mere flights of fantasy or instruments of political power and control. They link us to our past, provide us with critical insight into the present and enable us to envision our lives not just as they are but as they should be or might become. Imaginative knowledge is not something you have today and discard tomorrow. It is a way of perceiving the world and relating to it. Primo Levi once said, &#x201c;I write in order to rejoin the community of mankind.&#x201d; Reading is a private act, but it joins us across continents and time.</p><p>But perhaps there is another, more personal reason for my disagreement with Ramin: I cannot imagine myself feeling at home in a place that is indifferent to what has become my true home, a land with no borders and few restrictions, which I have taken to calling &#x201c;the Republic of Imagination.&#x201d; I think of it as Nabokov&#x2019;s &#x201c;somehow, somewhere&#x201d; or Alice&#x2019;s backyard, a world that runs parallel to the real one, whose occupants need no passport or documentation. The only requirements for entry are an open mind, a restless desire to know and an indefinable urge to escape the mundane.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Long before I made America my home, I inhabited its fiction, its poetry, its music and films. My first fictional journey to America took place when I was about seven, when my English tutor in Tehran introduced me to <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>. Our main text was a book with simple stories about a pair of American siblings, predictably a girl and a boy. One peculiar feature of these two fiercely clean and well-groomed urchins was that no matter what happened to them, their expressions were fixed in a perpetual smile. I knew their names (was it Jack and Jill? Dick and Jane?), their last names (the Smiths? the Joneses? the Partridges?), where they lived, their daily routine, their school. None of these small and essential details have stayed with me. There was little in their world that made me want to know these smiling, immaculately groomed children any better. The only thing I remember about that book, the one thing that was slightly interesting, was its cover: gritty to the touch, with an image of the two siblings foregrounded on a dark green background.</p><p>Near the end of each session, my tutor would close our exercise book and make her way to the kitchen, from which she would emerge with a glass of cherry sherbet and a worn copy of <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. </i>She read only a few pages each time, keeping me in suspense, impatient for our next meeting. Sometimes she would tell me stories from the book or have me read a short passage. I was mesmerized by the orphan Dorothy, who lived in the middle of a flat gray landscape somewhere in the middle of nowhere with her dour and hardworking aunt and uncle and whose only cheerful companion was her dog, Toto. What would happen to her when a cyclone lifted her up with her house, with Toto trapped inside, and landed them in a magical place called Oz? Like millions of children, I impatiently followed Dorothy and her growing group of friends in search of the mighty Wizard of Oz, the only person who could give the Scarecrow a mind, the Tin Man a heart and the Lion courage, and make possible Dorothy&#x2019;s journey home.</p><p>Had I been able to formulate my first impressions of the United States, I might have said that there was a place in America called Kansas, where people could find a magic land at the heart of a cyclone. Because that was the first time I had heard the word &#x201c;cyclone,&#x201d; I can honestly say that <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz </i>taught me both its real and imagined meanings. Kansas and Omaha were soon followed by a river called Mississippi and many more cities, rivers, forests, lakes and people&#x2014;the orderly suburban households of Nancy Drew, the frontier towns of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> and stormy plantations of <i>Gone with the Wind,</i> the Kentucky farm of <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> and the dusty, sultry southern streets of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird, </i>where justice was as embattled a notion as it would soon be in Tehran. Later, these were joined by Faulkner&#x2019;s Mississippi, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s St. Paul, Edith Wharton&#x2019;s New York and then Richard Wright&#x2019;s and Ralph Ellison&#x2019;s very different New York, Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s Los Angeles and the southern towns of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Eudora Welty and Carson McCullers. Even now I feel there are so many geographical and fictional terrains left to discover. Perhaps this was the main reason why I could not agree with Ramin: America, to my mind, cannot be separated from its fiction.</p><p>When they were young my parents were not wealthy, but all through their lives the one thing they never hesitated to give my brother and me was books. They would entrust friends who traveled abroad with long lists of titles they couldn&#x2019;t find for us in Tehran. As I grew up and wanted the things my friends had, my father would tell me time and again in different ways that I should not focus on things. Possessions, he would say, can&#x2019;t be relied on&#x2014;they&#x2019;re easier to lose than to obtain. You should value what you can carry with you until the day you die. </p><p>One of the first books my father brought home for me to read in English was <i>Tom and Jerry</i>. I still remember when he gave me <i>The Little Prince</i> and <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web,</i> which taught me that something as fragile and forgettable as a spider&#x2019;s web could offer up a hidden universe. When I first read <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,</i> I was intrigued by Tom&#x2019;s seductive charm but did not really like him&#x2014;maybe his bag was too full of tricks. In time, books and the world of the imagination they unlocked would become the portable possessions my father had hoped I would always carry with me.</p><p>Every Thursday evening, he would take me to a movie house in the fun part of town and I looked forward to our private time together all week. I remember walking hand in hand with him down Naderi Avenue, itself like a scene in an impressionist movie, with its chaotic shops selling nuts, spices, coffee, pirashki and ice cream. Alongside Iranian films, we saw ones starring Ismail Yasin, Fernandel, Norman Wisdom and Vittorio De Sica and the romantic dramas of the Indian superstars Raj Kapoor and Nargis. And, of course, we saw American films: <i>Spartacus</i> and <i>Ivanhoe, Mogambo,</i> Laurel and Hardy, <i>South Pacific </i>and one of my favorites, Danny Kaye&#x2019;s <i>Hans Christian Andersen</i>. I was not sure what to make of American musicals, where characters suddenly started gyrating in the middle of a meal or while walking down the street, as if overtaken by a mischievous genie, bursting into song only to calm down the next minute and resume eating or talking or kissing. Ever since, I have thought of America as a land of song and dance. From an early age I nurtured an idea of America that I believed in even if I knew that its reality, like any reality, was certain to fall short in some way and disappoint.</p><p>My father translated the tales of La Fontaine for my brother and me, doing all of the drawings himself, and wrote simplified versions of the classic Persian poets Ferdowsi and Nezami. More than anything when I think of him, this is what I remember: his sharing of his time and pleasure with me, as if I were his equal, his companion and co-consipirator. There was no moral lesson to be drawn; it was an act of love, but also of respect and trust.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Eleven years have now passed since I met Ramin at that bookstore in Seattle, and since then I have traveled thousands of miles over thirty-two states, conversing mainly about the subject he and I talked about that day. And he did have a point. Between my first book tour, in 2003, and the next one, in 2009, many of the places I visited had undergone a significant transformation or vanished: Cody&#x2019;s in Berkeley, seven branch libraries in Philadelphia, twelve of the fourteen bookstores in Harvard Square, Harry W. Schwartz in Milwaukee and, in my own hometown of Washington, D.C., Olsson&#x2019;s and Chapters. At first it was the independent bookstores, then came the bigger chains: Borders (I wrote <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> at the Borders on Eighteenth and L, now a Nordstrom Rack) and, more recently, the Barnes &amp; Noble in Georgetown, replaced by a cavernous Nike store&#x2014;and the list goes on. </p><p>It is not just bookstores and libraries that are disappearing but museums, theaters, performing arts centers, art and music schools&#x2014;all those places where I felt at home have joined the list of endangered species. <i>The San Francisco Chronicle,</i> the<i> Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>Boston Globe</i> and my own hometown paper, <i>The Washington Post,</i> have all closed their weekend book review sections, leaving books orphaned and stranded, poor cousins to television and the movies. In a sign of the times, the Bloomberg News website recently transferred its book coverage to the Luxury section, alongside yachts, sports clubs and wine, as if to signal that books are an idle indulgence of the super-rich. But if there is one thing that should not be denied to anyone rich or poor it is the opportunity to dream. </p><p>Long before that extremely cold, sunny morning in December 2008 when I took a loyalty oath at an Immigration Services office in Fairfax, Virginia, and finally became an American citizen, I had often asked myself, What transforms a country from a place you simply live in or use as a refuge into a home? At what point do &#x201c;they&#x201d; become &#x201c;us?&#x201d; When you choose to call a place home, you no longer treat it with the episodic curiosity of a guest or a visitor. You are concerned with the good and the bad. Its shortcomings are no longer merely topics of conversation. You wonder, Why are things this way and not another? You want to improve the place, to change it, to make your complaints known. And I had done enough complaining by then to know it was time I became an American citizen.</p><p>When the founding fathers conceived of this new nation, they understood that the education of its citizens would be essential to the health of their democratic enterprise. Knowledge was not just a luxury; it was essential. In those days, men who worked for a living were not thought to be fit for public life and a liberal arts education was essential for anyone aspiring to join the political class of the new republic. Over time, politics became a more contentious enterprise, and a new political class was born that had little time for cultivated gentleman farmers who read Cicero and Tacitus for pleasure. Of course, the founding fathers&#x2019; hope was that one day all Americans, regardless of their wealth or station, would have an opportunity to read Tacitus and Cicero. The point of their new democracy was not just to vote but to make accessible to most citizens what had until then been enjoyed by only a few. Museums, libraries and schools were built to further this democratic ideal. Jefferson, who spent his life collecting books, many of which he donated to the Library of Congress, boasted that America was the ...</p></p><h2>When To Sell: Inside Strategies for Stock Market Profits</h2><p>A classic book that was updated and revised in 1994, now with an updated foreword written by the author. A meaningful analysis, a few rules to follow, how to choose good charts, and numerous case histories. Guidelines to follow which help you to be self-reliant.</p><p>Since the original publication of When to Sell in 1977, which was cited by the New York Times as one of the two or three best books ever written on the stock market, Justin Mamis gets the phone calls asking &#34;how do we know when to sell?&#34; Of course these phone calls come after the market has gone down. When prices are up, investors should be looking for &#34;when to sell&#34;. Indentifying tops -- the emotions that accompany tops, the indicators that say it is a top, the stock actions that warns that it is getting to be time to sell - these are the meat of the book When to Sell. This book was completely rewritten in 1995 and now includes a new foreword by the author. Although many specifics have changed since the original book was first published over twenty years ago, there are also many consistent verities that need to be repeated. It still takes just as long to make a top, the same sort of failures can be identified whether one is dealing with American Buggy Whip or Microsoft and it still requires both patience and belief -- patience to wait for a big enough top to form and belief that it really is a top and thus has become time to sell.After serving as Assistant Director of the NYSE Floor Department, Justin Mamis founded and edited The Professional Tape Reader in 1972, selling it in 1977 to its current editor with thoughts of retirement. Instead he spent several years as an "upstairs" Member-Trader for Phelan, Silver, an NYSE specialist firm and subsequently settled into his roles as market advisory letter writer, forecaster, and philosopher on behalf of Wertheim &amp; Co., and then Gordon Capital. He then became Senior Vice President and Chief Market Technician at Hancock, where he wrote his weekly Mamis Letter. Quotes from the Mamis Letter appear frequently in Barron's and The Wall Street Journal and his often heretical and usually grumpy comments can be heard from time to time on CNBC. Among his credentials he has been voted for several consecutive years to the Institutional Investor "All-Star Team" in the categories of Market Timing and Market Technician. Justin continues to write his market letter and do forecasting and philosophizing.</p><h2>Victorian Radicals: From the Pre-Raphaelites to the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement</h2><p><b>This generously illustrated and exciting new study of the Victorian era features rarely seen works, provocative essays, and a striking, period-inspired design.</b><br><br>Although the word "Victorian" connotes a kind of dry propriety, the artists working in the Victorian era were anything but. Starting with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and lasting through the dawn of the 20th century, the era's painters, writers, and designers challenged every prevailing belief about art and its purpose. The full spectrum of the Victorian avant-garde is in magnificent display in this book that features nearly 150 works drawn from the city of Birmingham's unparalleled collection. Characterized by attention to detail, vibrant colors, and engagement with literary themes and daily life, the paintings, works on paper, and decorative objects featured reveal the myriad ways Victorian artists and artisans made sense of a rapidly changing world. Perceptive essays and the latest scholarship illuminate the issues these artists contended with, including the relationship to art and nature, questions of class and gender identity, the value of handmade versus machine production, and the search for beauty in an age of industry. Designed to reflect the tactile nature of the work and featuring typography inspired by the Victorian era, this beautiful volume is as fresh and bold as the visionaries it celebrates.<br><b>Copublished by the American Federation of Arts and DelMonico Books</b></p><p>MARTIN ELLIS is a freelance curator, lecturer, and broadcaster and former Curator of Applied Art at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, England.<br><br>TIMOTHY BARRINGER is the Paul Mellon Professor and Chair of the History of Art at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. <br><br>VICTORIA OSBORNE is Curator of Fine Art for Birmingham Museums Trust, England.</p><h2>A Gift of Grace: A Novel (Kauffman Amish Bakery Series)</h2><p><p><strong>When Amish Rebecca Kauffman gains custody of her English nieces, &#x201c;blended family&#x201d; takes on a whole new meaning. </strong></p><p>Rebecca Kauffman&#x2019;s tranquil Old Order Amish life is transformed when she suddenly becomes guardian to her two teenage nieces after her English sister and brother-in-law are killed in an automobile accident.

The boy, Leo, treasures his bicycle so much he gives it a name -- Big Red. But eventually Leo outgrows Big Red, and this is where the bicycle&#39;s story takes a turn from the everyday, because Leo decides to donate it to an organization that ships bicycles to Africa. Big Red is sent to Burkina Faso, in West Africa, where it finds a home with Alisetta, who uses it to gain quicker access to her family&#39;s sorghum field and to the market. Then, over time, it finds its way to a young woman named Haridata, who has a new purpose for the bicycle -- renamed Le Grand Rouge -- delivering medications and bringing sick people to the hospital. This book makes an excellent choice for cultural studies classes; author Jude Isabella has provided several terrific suggestions in the back of the book for projects large and small, while a map shows the distance the bicycle traveled across the Atlantic Ocean. Award-winning illustrator Simone Shin&#39;s digitally composed artwork includes evocative depictions of Alisetta&#39;s and Haridata&#39;s communities in rural Africa, creating vivid comparisons between Leo&#39;s life and their lives. Youngsters will learn how different the world is for those who rely on bicycles as a mode of transportation, and how one ordinary bicycle -- and a child&#39;s desire to make a difference -- can change lives across the world. This book also offers an excellent opportunity for expanding character education lessons on caring, compassion and empathy to include the wider world.</p><p>Jude Isabella started writing kids books when she was managing editor of YES Mag: Canada&#39;s Science Magazine for Kids. Her inspiration mostly comes from paying attention to things that make her laugh and things that make her angry (she learned that from a famous journalist named Molly Ivins).Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Part of Kids Can's globally themed series, this tale of the journey of one bicycle imparts important lessons on recycling and social responsibility. After Leo outgrows his beloved childhood bike, Big Red, he donates it to an organization that ships bikes overseas to those who can't afford them. Though he's initially reluctant to part with his cherished possession, he soon realizes that it will benefit a new owner. Big Red is given to Alisetta, a young girl in Burkina Faso who uses it to transport sorghum to market. When Alisetta in turn outgrows Big Red, it's given to a medical clinic, where it becomes an ambulance. Children will get a strong sense of global citizenship and unity from the simple yet effective narrative. Shin's digitally composed illustrations are folksy and vibrant, perfect for this cross-cultural tale, and expressively convey the faces of those who interact with Big Red. Back matter includes some useful information on real-life organizations that arrange for bike donations, a brief note on Burkina Faso, and challenges and activities for educators to do with children. VERDICT A strong option for social studies curricula, this noteworthy title will encourage kids to think globally.&#x2014;Kathryn Diman, Bass Harbor Memorial Library, Bernard, ME</p><h2>Ghost Moon (The Bone Island Trilogy)</h2><p><br><br>Reclusive collector Cutter Merlin is seldom seen in Key West&#x2014;lately, not at all. Officer Liam Beckett visits Merlin's curious house and discovers the gentleman in his study. In his death grip: a volume of occult lore and a reliquary. His eyes are wide with fright, his mouth a horrified rictus where spiders now dwell. <br><br> Kelsey Donovan returns to the old house to catalog her estranged grandfather's collection of artifacts and antiquities, vowing to see his treasures divested properly. But she cannot ignore the sense that she's being watched, the reports of malevolent black figures, the pervasive smell of death. <br><br> Is the Merlin house haunted, even cursed? Liam knows well that <em>some</em> ghost stories are true and he swears to protect Kelsey. But there are forces at work for whom one more life is a pittance to pay for their deepest desire.... <br><br></p><p><em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> bestselling author <strong>Heather Graham</strong> has written more than a hundred novels.

She answered it distractedly.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Kelsey? Is this Kelsey Donovan?"<br><br>It was odd, Kelsey thought later, that she didn't recognize Liam Beckett's voice the minute he called, but, then again, it had been a long, long time since she had heard it, and they'd both been basically children at the time.<br><br>His voice was low, deep, confident and well-cultured, with the tiniest hint of the South. Naturally&#x2014;they were from the southernmost city in the United States, even if that city had never been completely typically Southern or typically anything at all. Key West was an olio of countries, times, and people, and accents came from across the globe.<br><br>And still...<br><br>"It's Liam."<br><br>"Liam Beckett?"<br><br>"Yes, Kelsey. Hello. I'm sorry to be calling you. Well, I'm not sorry to be calling you, I'm just sorry because of...the news I have to give you."<br><br>Her heart seemed to sink several inches down into her stomach.<br><br>"It's Cutter, isn't it?" she asked.<br><br>"I'm afraid so, Kelsey." He was quiet a minute. "I'm afraid he died a couple of days ago. We just found him."<br><br>A heart couldn't sink lower than into the stomach, could it? It seemed that the depths of her body burned with sorrow and regret. It was human, she tried to tell herself, to put off until tomorrow what should have been done today. She hadn't gone back.<br><br>Why in hell had she never gone back? She had meant to, she had promised Cutter Merlin, her only living relative, that she would do so. And yet...<br><br>Even after her father had passed away, there had been that dark, empty place that had made her afraid to do so.<br><br>"Kelsey? Are you there?"<br><br>"Yes, I'm here. I'm... Thank you. Thank you for calling me."<br><br>"Of course." He was silent, and then he cleared his throat awkwardly. "Well, there are matters, of course, that must be dealt with. The property is yours&#x2014;and the decision on the final arrangements for his interment are yours as well, of course."<br><br>"Um..." She couldn't think. She didn't want to think. She didn't want to sit here and think of herself as being such a low and callous human being for not having gone back. Whatever had happened when she had been a teenager, she didn't think that it had been her grandfather's fault, no matter what her father had believed. And her father hadn't actually called Cutter evil, he had told her he was a good man. He hadn't even said that the house was <em>evil. </em>But there had been something. She had known that her father believed that her mother's death hadn't been an <em>accident, </em>and that he had taken Kelsey away from the house because he had wanted her away from Cutter Merlin.<br><br>But the man had been her grandfather, her flesh and blood! She had spoken with him on the phone after her father's death, and she had said that she would come out. But there had been the awful grief of losing her father, and then the flurry of work to learn to live with the fact that he was gone. And then...and then...<br><br>She had meant to go down to see him. She hadn't. And that's the way it was, and now he was gone, too, and she was a horrible human being. Liam had said that they had just found him, but...<br><br>He had been dead some time. He had died alone, and his body had just sat there alone in death, because he had been so alone in life.<br><br>"Kelsey?"<br><br>"I'm here."<br><br>"His attorney was Joe Richter. I'll text you the phone number and address. I suppose you can come here yourself, or make whatever arrangements you'd like with Joe."<br><br>"Sure. Thank you." She still felt numb&#x2014;and filled with regret. She didn't like herself very much at the moment. She roused herself, though, curious as to why it was Liam who had called her.<br><br>"Um&#x2014;how is it that you're calling?" she asked.<br><br>"I'm a cop these days," he told her. "And we've had a few shake-ups in the department lately, so... Anyway, old times, I suppose. When his mail carrier reported that he wasn't collecting his mail, I went to the house. I found him."<br><br>A cop. Of course, Liam was a cop. He'd wanted to solve every riddle, put together the pieces of any puzzle. Once, when a school lab rat had disappeared, he had discovered that Sam Henley had stolen the creature to take home; he'd pretended to find Sam's fingerprint on the rat cage, and Sam had quickly squealed&#x2014;like a rat.<br><br>She closed her eyes. She was thinking about Liam. And Cutter was dead.<br><br>"Was it a heart attack?" she asked.<br><br>There seemed to be a little beat in time before he answered.<br><br>"Apparently. But his body is still with the M.E. Just procedure," he said.<br><br>But there had been something odd in his voice!<br><br>"Please go ahead and call Joe, Kelsey. Let him know what you'd like. Are you still drawing?"<br><br>The new question took a moment to comprehend. She was surprised that he remembered how she had loved drawing.<br><br>"I'm a cartoonist. I have a column, and we do a little animated thing on the web," she said. "I have an animator partner, and we're doing fairly well. Thanks for asking."<br><br>"That sounds great. Well..."<br><br>His voice trailed off. He was a cop. He was busy.<br><br>"Thank you again, Liam. I'm glad the news came from you."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Kelsey. Though I guess it's been a while since you'd seen Cutter."<br><br>"We had talked," she told him. Ah, yes, there were defensive tones to her words!<br><br>"Take care," he told her.<br><br>"Of course, thank you&#x2014;you, too."<br><br>The phone went dead in her hands. She still didn't move for several minutes.<br><br>The room darkened around her. Only the bright light above her drafting table gave illumination to her apartment.<br><br>She liked where she lived. People often thought of the L.A. area as rather a hellhole of plastic people and traffic.<br><br>But Hollywood had neighborhoods. She didn't have to travel most of the time; she worked from home. She had great theater around her, and wonderful music venues. A decent, busy life in a place where there were actually local bars and coffee shops, where she knew the owners of the small restaurants near her and where, day by day, things were pleasant, good.<br><br>She didn't need to go back. She could call Joe Richter, and he could make any arrangements that might be necessary.<br><br>No, she couldn't. She owed Cutter the decency of arranging a funeral herself.<br><br>A beep notified her that Liam Beckett had sent her the text with Joe's information.<br><br>She would call him in the morning. She swiveled in her chair from the drafting board to her computer. And she keyed up the airlines, and made a reservation to reach Key West.<br><br>She was going home.<br><br>Once the reservation was made, she found herself thinking about her father. He'd been a good man. He'd loved her mother so much, and her, too. And he'd even loved Cutter Merlin, she thought. But when they had moved away, she had asked him why, and he had told her, "Because it isn't safe, kitten. Because it just isn't safe to be around Cutter, or that house, or...all that he has done. That man will never be safe, in life...or in death."<br><br>The call came when Liam was off duty, when he was down at O'Hara's having dinner&#x2014;the special for the night, fish and chips.<br><br>His cousin David was frequently there, since David was about to marry Katie, Jamie O'Hara's niece, and the karaoke hostess at her uncle's bar. They'd all grown up together. Liam had stayed, while David had gone, until he'd returned recently. Sean, Katie's brother, had also spent many of his adult years working around the world. Like David, he'd gone into photography and then film.<br><br>There were others, friends of various ages, sexes, colors, shapes and sizes, who were local, and the locals came to O'Hara's with a standard frequency, though the place also catered to tourists&#x2014;in Key West, tourism was just about the only industry.<br><br>The fish was fresh&#x2014;caught that afternoon&#x2014;and delicious, but he'd barely begun his meal, sympathizing with David about the problems inherent in planning a wedding when Jack Nissan called him from the station.<br><br>"I just got a call&#x2014;something is going on over at the Merlin house. I know you cared about the old fellow and contacted his granddaughter. I thought that maybe you wanted to be the one to check it out," Jack told him. "If not, I'm sorry to have called."<br><br>"Who called, and what is the something going on?" Liam asked.<br><br>"Mrs. Shriver. She could see the place across the water from the wharf area. She said she saw lights, and knew that we'd found the old fellow dead. Should I just send someone on patrol to check it out?"<br><br>"No, Jack, thanks. I'll go on over," Liam told him.<br><br>"What is it?" David asked.<br><br>"A report of lights over at the Merlin house," Liam said.<br><br>"Want me to come with you?" David asked.<br><br>"No, it's all right. I'll be back. I'll see you later."<br><br>When he headed out to his car, Liam knew that he was being followed. He paused, turning around.<br><br>Bartholomew.<br><br>Not everyone saw Bartholomew, and frankly, he'd been among the last in their group to really <em>see </em>the pirate.<br><br>Bartholomew had died in the eighteen hundreds. First, Bartholomew had attached himself to Katie O'Hara.<br><br>Then, somehow, he had become Sean O'Hara's ghost, and now, with the world quiet&#x2014;and, Liam assumed, because the others were all living basically normal lives and were romantically involved&#x2014;Bartholomew had decided to haunt him.<br><br>It was quite sad, really. He'd listened to his cousin and the others talk about Bartholomew, but he might have actually believed that it was all part of a strange mass hallucination because of the danger they had been in.<br><br>But then, Bartholomew had decided that he needed to attach himself to Liam. It had been after the affair out on Haunt Island, when, his cousin David had assured him, the ghost had been instrumental in saving a number of lives.<br><br>At first, seeing a ghost was definitely disturbing. And as far as that went, he'd assumed you'd see some wisp of mist in the air&#x2014;hear the rattle of chains&#x2014;or the like. But seeing Bartholomew was like seeing any would-be contemporary costumed pirate in Key West.<br><br>The pirate&#x2014;or privateer&#x2014;had been a good man. He could be a fine conversationalist, and had certainly helped them all in times of great distress.<br><br>It was still unnerving to be followed about by a ghost few others could see, a man in an elegant brocade frock coat, ruffled shirt and waistcoat, and tricornered hat. Since it was Key West, with Fantasy Fest and Pirates in Paradise&#x2014;not to mention Hemingway Days&#x2014;it shouldn't have felt that odd to be followed about by anyone in any attire&#x2014;or lack thereof. Though it was illegal to travel the streets nude, there were those who&gt;did try it during Fantasy Fest, when body paint was the rage.<br><br>Katie O'Hara, was the one who had been born with the sixth sense, gift, curse or whatever one wanted to call it that allowed people to <em>see </em>what others did not. Liam didn't think that the rest of them had anything that remotely resembled Katie's gifts. But they had all survived events in which what wasn't at all <em>ordinary </em>had played a major part.<br><br>And they all knew there were forces in the world that weren't visible to the naked eye.<br><br>And he should have been accustomed to Bartholomew by now.<br><br>In life, Bartholomew had surely been a dashing and charming individual. Even in death, he was quite a character: intelligent and with a keen sense of justice.<br><br>"What?" Liam said, spinning around.<br><br>Bartholomew stopped short. "What do you mean, <em>what? </em>Cutter Merlin was found dead in a most unusual way, and, God knows, the place had its reputation. You just may need me."<br><br>"It's going to turn out to be kids, I'm willing to bet," Liam said. "Teenagers who know the man died and want to break into a haunted house."<br><br>Bartholomew shrugged. "I'm just along for the ride," he said. "I haven't seen it yet. The place sounds extremely unusual, and I'm fascinated."<br><br>Liam groaned. "All right, let's go."<br><br>Liam supposed it was natural that people&#x2014;young and old&#x2014;would find the Merlin house fascinating, and that it did make a great haunted house. Once, of course, it had been a beautiful grand dame, but time had done its work, and with Cutter Merlin being old and alone, it had taken on that aura of decay long before the gentleman had passed. Then, of course, there was the truth&#x2014;he had been a collector of oddities, including human remains such as mummies and shrunken heads.<br><br>It was a little more than a mile down Duval and around Front Street and then down around the little peninsula to reach the Merlin house. Liam parked in the overgrown yard. He exited the car and stared at the place, but not even the porch light he had left on after Merlin's body had been removed was still shining. A burned-out bulb? Or was a prankster inside?<br><br>"That's one eerie residence," Bartholomew commented.<br><br>Liam shrugged and walked up the path to the porch. He tried the front door and found it unlocked. He knew that it had been locked and they had sealed up the entrance over the washer and dryer. Merlin's attorney, Joe Richter, had the only other set of keys.<br><br>He stepped in. Somehow, the house still seemed to have an aura of death about it.<br><br>He tried the light switch by the front door, but nothing happened. He turned on his flashlight, and the parlor was illuminated.<br><br>An odd whisper emanated through the house. In his mind's eye, Liam thought about the layout of the house. The front door faced south and Old Town, Key West. Cutter's library or office was to the left, and behind it was a workroom. <br><br></p><h2>The Ancient Blacks of China</h2><p>In this book we discuss the history of Blacks in China from the Neolithic up to the rise of the Southeast Asian civilizations.</p><p></p><h2>Diabolically Hard Fireball Crosswords: 45 Ultra-Tough Puzzles</h2><p>Solvers in search of devilishly hard crosswords will find the ultimate challenge in these 45 diabolical puzzles!

Somewhere between watching the lovely Sugar Plum Fairy twirling around on stage during a local production of <i>The Nutcracker </i>and trying on my mother&#x2019;s satiny wedding dress, I decided beyond a shadow of a doubt exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up...a beautiful princess. The fact that princesses were unheard-of in modern-day America did not bother me. I was convinced that somehow, someway, someday I would become one. It was not that I considered myself especially beautiful or princesslike. In fact, staring into the bathroom mirror one morning at my stringy hair and crooked teeth, I decided that the only remedy was a makeover, which I skillfully applied after digging in my mom&#x2019;s makeup drawer. (The story of my memorable venture out into public that day with my bright pink cheeks, dark green eyelids, and vibrant orange lips is quite an unfortunate tale.) That was the end of my makeup escapades for the time being, but I held out hope that one day I would grow into a dazzling beauty like Cathy Henderson (my all-time favorite baby-sitter), with her supercool, neon pink nail polish and Barbie-like locks. <br>But much more than polished nails and eternally good hair days, it seemed to me that the <i>really </i>necessary requirement for becoming a princess was to find a noble prince: a knight in shining armor who would consider me the most desirable girl in the world, sweep me off my feet, rescue me from peril, carry me away to his castle, and cherish me forever. Sleeping Beauty had Prince Charming. Malibu Barbie had Ken. The Sugar Plum Fairy had the Nutcracker. The Beautiful Bride (a.k.a. my mother) had the Handsome Groom (a.k.a. my father). Even Cathy Henderson had the curly haired Scotty Darnell wrapped around her finger. Finding a prince of my own seemed like a reasonable goal.<br>It was a childish dream, a girlish desire that budded in my heart long before I knew anything about the real world. But for some inexplicable reason, it was a dream that I longed to come true more than I had ever longed for anything in my entire life. I desperately wanted to become a princess. It was a dream that I treasured, even as I grew older. It was a desire that remained rooted deep within my heart long after Malibu Barbie and her convertible were packed away in Styrofoam peanuts up in the attic. But things were about to change, and change dramatically. In my early childhood innocence, I had no way of knowing the weighty price that would soon be demanded of a young girl who dares to enter the real world holding on to the foolish dream of becoming a princess...<br><br>THE DREAM BEGAN to fade when I was ten. I was standing by the water fountain with Mandy and Katie, my two fifth-grade bosom buddies. We were deeply engaged in an animated discussion about the many virtues of Sour Patch Kids, the latest candy craze to hit Crestview Elementary since Nerds had come on the scene a year before. Then, seemingly from out of nowhere, a small group of fifthgrade boys surrounded us, laughing obnoxiously and jolting Mandy out of an awe-inspiring tale of her recent attempt to eat <i>five </i>Sour Patch Kids all at the same time. Katie rolled her eyes and looked at the boys in annoyance.<br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; she demanded.<br>The ringleader, Andy Archibald, only smirked at Katie. Andy was a loud, skinny kid in baggy Levi&#x2019;s who brought three or four Twinkies in his lunch nearly every day of the week. (I had noticed this fact with great envy, since my mom was a health nut, and the &#x201c;treats&#x201d; in my lunchbox were usually carrot sticks and sugar-free granola bars.) <br>&#x201c;Go <i>away</i>!&#x201d; Katie ordered in an irritated voice. Andy didn&#x2019;t budge. His sly grin grew wider. He stepped a little closer to her. The rest of the boys began to snicker.<br>&#x201c;Timmy <i>likes </i>you,&#x201d; Andy finally announced triumphantly, as the snickering grew louder. Timmy immediately shoved Andy against the water fountain, protesting loudly with a swear word. I quickly looked around to see if any teachers had heard him. Fifth graders were not allowed to cuss in school (we were told that once we reached middle school we would be grown up enough to say whatever we wanted in the halls). I expected the Cussing Police to come rushing over, grab Timmy by the earlobe to drag him off to the principal&#x2019;s office, and force-feed him a bar of Dial. But no adult was anywhere in sight. I found myself strangely disappointed that Timmy&#x2019;s great sin had not created more of a scandal.<br>My thoughts on this were short-lived, however, because Andy had recovered from Timmy&#x2019;s outburst and seemed to be gaining momentum. &#x201c;Timmy thinks you&#x2019;re a <i>babe,</i>&#x201d; he crooned to Katie in his grating, prepubertized voice, as Timmy yelled, &#x201c;Shut <i>up, </i>dude!&#x201d;<br>Katie&#x2019;s face had turned bright red, and she was staring at the floor.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; piped in Jason Smits, a squirrelly kid with oversized glasses, &#x201c;Timmy thinks you&#x2019;re hot, cuz you re <i>de-vel-op-ing</i>!&#x201d; He pointed at Katie&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;You have to wear a <i>training </i>bra!&#x201d; At this, the entire group of boys burst into wild, uncontrollable laughter. Katie pursed her lips together in humiliation and hugged her science book tightly against her chest. Mandy glared at the boys but remained speechless. I looked around the hallway again, realizing that there were still no adults anywhere near us to come to the rescue. I decided it was up to me to defend Katie&#x2019;s honor.<br>&#x201c;Leave her alone, you jerks!&#x201d; I burst out. I immediately wished I had kept my mouth shut. The hyper group of boys suddenly turned their full attention on me, and I went from feeling like Wonder Woman to Minnie Mouse in a matter of seconds. Andy curled his lip cynically and looked me up and down.<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, nudging the kid next to him, &#x201c;check out <i>this </i>ugly chick&#x2014;she&#x2019;s flatter than the plains of Kansas!&#x201d; The boys howled. Jason quickly opened his mouth to outdo Andy&#x2019;s insult, but before any more verbal abuse could occur, our teacher decided to appear.<br>&#x201c;Okay, boys and girls, let&#x2019;s get back in line. Our break is over. It&#x2019;s time for our science lesson!&#x201d; she called out happily, oblivious to the drama that had just unfolded. The snickering group of boys quickly dispersed, and we were herded into the classroom to learn about the exciting process of metamorphosis.<br>While Miss Thompson began her lecture on the larval stage of a caterpillar, I was vaguely aware of new, confusing emotions dancing around in my heart. Since I was only ten, I hadn&#x2019;t had much experience being scrutinized, criticized, and discarded by members of the opposite sex. It was a strange sensation, and it created a knot in my stomach that seemed to linger there all afternoon. Andy Archibald&#x2019;s words rang over and over in my ears. It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to work this way, I told myself in bewilderment. There was a marked difference, I noticed, in the way Andy Archibald had treated <i>me </i>and the way the beautiful princess was treated by her prince in all the stories I had grown up with. The men in the fairy tales treated women as valuable treasures, to be prized and cherished. The &#x201c;men&#x201d; in the fifth grade at Crestview Elementary seemed to treat us the same way they treated their soccer ball&#x2014;like something to be roughly kicked around for fun, then tossed unnoticed into a corner of the playground. The longer I sat thinking, the more I found it hard to believe that boys actually <i>noticed </i>which girls were wearing training bras and which were still wearing pink cotton undershirts, like me. I had never been insecure about it until that day; in fact, I had never really given it much thought. My friends and I were usually too busy discussing Sour Patch Kids and Care Bears to obsess over our bodies. And until that day by the water fountain, the boys in my class had always spent most of their energy trading baseball cards and telling the latest Peewee Herman jokes. But now, they seemed to have found a new, more exciting pastime&#x2014;tormenting us about how we looked.<br>Boys like Andy, Timmy, and Jason had always tried to irritate the girls by flipping their eyelids inside out or cracking all their knuckles at once. But now, overnight, they seemed to have realized that they could get a far bigger reaction from us by brutally teasing us about the fascinating new phrases they had learned last week from Miss Thompson in health class. They had started using new words like <i>developing, </i>or Katie&#x2019;s most recent downfall, <i>training bra. </i>Though Miss Thompson had emphatically explained that these matters were nothing to giggle or be ashamed about, the boys hadn&#x2019;t seemed to catch the part about not laughing. As for not being ashamed about it, I found myself suddenly wanting to ask Miss Thompson how a tenyear-old was <i>not </i>supposed to feel embarrassed while facing a group of boys howling about the fact that she had not yet developed. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that Miss Thompson and our new workbook called <i>My Body </i>were partly to blame for<br>this strange and unwelcome change that had come over the Crestview Elementary fifth-grade boys.<br>Another possibility I considered might somehow be related was the magazine that Andy Archibald had discovered under his older brother&#x2019;s bed. I had heard Andy telling Jason Smits all about it during Susie Montgomery&#x2019;s oral report on the planet Jupiter a few days before. From what I could tell, it was a magazine with nothing but pictures of women who apparently were not wearing very many clothes, and the boys used the word <i>babe </i>repeatedly as they whispered to each other about it. It sounded like a boring magazine to me. I couldn&#x2019;t understand why Andy and Jason were so excited about it. But it had seemed to awaken them to this new idea of studying all the girls and deciding whether or not they were hot. Whatever was causing the boys to act this way, I knew one thing for sure: being subject to their cruelty was <i>not </i>getting me any closer to becoming a princess. In fact, I was beginning to feel more like one of Cinderella&#x2019;s ugly stepsisters than the lovely girl with the glass slipper. A seed of doubt had entered my mind&#x2014;maybe my dream of becoming a beautiful princess and being cherished by a noble prince was simply not possible for someone like me. Maybe it only happened for girls like Snow White or Malibu Barbie. Maybe men would always see me as ugly and undesirable. Maybe I was not pretty enough, or talented enough, or vivacious enough. Maybe in order to be found attractive...<i>I </i>needed to change.<br><br>BY THE TIME I was thirteen, thoughts of becoming a princess had all but disappeared from my mind. After three years filled with hundreds of moments like the one by the water fountain at Crestview Elementary, listening to the taunts and barrages of snickering boys who examined and criticized nearly every part of my anatomy, I was tired. Tired of trying to convince myself that someday I would be beautiful. Tired of hoping for a noble prince to rescue me and carry me away to his castle. My desire to be loved and cherished by a gentle knight had not diminished, but had only grown more intense. Yet I had begun to question whether such a fairy tale could ever happen to me. I had innocently stumbled into the real world while holding tightly to my girlish ideals. In response, the world had laughed at my tender heart, mocked my deepest desires, and trampled on my treasured dreams.<br>Instead of wasting my time looking for a fairy tale, I finally determined that, in order to avoid as much painful rejection as I could, my energy would be better spent on making myself as desirable as possible to the opposite sex. After enduring one too many cynical jabs from greasy-haired boys like Andy, I knew I could not survive that way much longer.<br>Thankfully, I had become a little more&#x2014;<i>ahem</i>&#x2014;endowed than in my days at Crestview Elementary. I had also learned a few things by watching other girls around me as they interacted with guys. I decided it was time to put these new tricks into action. By now the guys had designed a new way of interacting with girls&#x2019; bodies that went far beyond examining them from a couple feet away.<br>In addition to continually scrutinizing and graphically describing our bodies, they had also developed the habit of attempting to grab, touch, and tickle anything feminine that ignited their hormones. How a girl responded to these gestures often determined the way she was treated from that point on.<br>One morning during my first week of eighth grade, as I was rummaging through the chaos in the bottom of my bright orange locker, I had an eye-opening experience. My friend Ashley had the locker next to mine, and she was passionately describing to me the horrors of Ms. Vickers (her militaristic English teacher) as she tried to shove a notebook into her already overflowing backpack. Suddenly, she was cornered by Matt Montoya and Tyler Pierce, two wiry basketball players with spiked hair and oversize shorts that showed off a good five inches of their boxers.<br>&#x201c;Hey, babe, how about a quickie in the bathroom?&#x201d; Matt panted into Ashley&#x2019;s ear as Tyler stood behind her and unhooked her bra through her Hard Rock Caf� T-shirt. I pretended to be captivated by the cover of my social studies book, but I watched the scene closely out of the corner of my eye. Instead of staring helplessly at the floor with a red face or angrily protesting in the name of sexual harassment, Ashley had a different and surprising reaction.<br>&#x201c;Ma-a-tt!&#x201d; she squealed, playfully pushing him away and giggling. Then she spun around with an affectionately annoyed smile at Tyler, who was just beginning to tug at the back of her jeans.<br>&#x201c;<i>Stop </i>it,&#x201d; she whined in a cute, lighthearted voice, looking up at him seductively as she skillfully rehooked her bra. Matt was not to be ignored. &#x201c;Come on, Ash,&#x201d; he crooned, sliding his hands down past her belt, &#x201c;just five minutes&#x2014;you and me?&#x201d; At that moment, the bell shrieked loudly from a speaker above us, and the steamy dialogue dissolved. With one last pinch near Ashley&#x2019;s back pocket, Matt slung his backpack over his arm, and he and Tyler strutted down the hall, laughing obnoxiously as they glanced back over their shoulders at Ashley, who was grinning back at them. I learned quickly. It seemed to me that the girls who responded to guys the way Ashley did knew exactly what they were doing. Instead of getting ridiculed and mocked by guys, they got drooled over, touched, and propositioned. Maybe this wasn&#x2019;t the ideal kind of male attention. Still, it was far less painful than complete humiliation and rejection, which is exactly what a girl would get if she showed any sign of resistance to their constant sexual attention. We had been taught in health class about the importance of standing up to sexual harassment and were told that we should not hesitate to come to any adult if we were being verbally assaulted at school. But this advice was so pathetically impractical, it was quickly tossed aside. What girl wanted to invite even more ridicule and torment by drawing attention to the fact that she was upset by the way the guys were treating her?...</p><h2>Victory in the Unseen Warfare</h2><p>Father Jack Sparks has masterfully adapted the material from this highly treasured monastic work specifically for today&#39;s lay Christian living in the midst of a modern world.

Are you making all the right moves in your career and still not receiving the recognition you have earned? Why do companies like Apple get all the attention, when you have difficulty getting anyone to focus on your efforts? In our homogenized world, companies in every sector--from big-box retail to financial services; from fast food to entrepreneurs--appear more and more alike, as do the tweets and LinkedIn pages of professionals across the country. But if people see you or your company as nothing more than a carbon copy of the competition, how can you expect to attract attention?<p> Scott McKain's original approach to this problem, first captured in his book <i>Collapse of Distinction</i>, was conceived and written in the direct aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown. His forceful case for the importance of distinction--finding success by setting yourself apart from the crowd--resonated with thousands of readers. To reflect the changing reality since that book's publication--and to incorporate new research and up-to-date examples--McKain, an internationally recognized expert on business distinction, has retitled and revised it as <i>Create Distinction</i>. Within these updated pages (including one entirely new chapter) you'll find a potent cure for similarity and uniformity--the primary killers of businesses and careers.<i> In engaging, story-filled prose, McKain lays out the cornerstones of distinction and equips you with the specific tools and knowledge you need to stand out. Whether you're in the ''C-suite'' of a multinational company or just vying for your next promotion, you'll learn how to rise above the fray and make your work unmistakable. With this practical advice, you'll feel confident stepping up from the competition--and toward success.</i></p></p><p>Scott McKain is the country's leading expert on business and professional distinction.

It was almost certainly a death sentence, but he miraculously survived and brought back with him an astounding story. During those 7 days in coma, he was plunged into the deepest realms of consciousness and came to understand profound truths about the universe we inhabit. What he learned changed everything he knew about the brain, mind, and consciousness and drove him to ask a question confounding the entire scientific community: How do you explain the origins of consciousness if it is not a byproduct of the brain? His challenge relates to a revolutionary shift now underway within our modern scientific understanding. Ultimately, direct experience is key to fully understanding how we are all connected through the binding force of unconditional love and its unlimited power to heal.<br><br>In <i>Living in a Mindful Universe,</i> the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Proof of Heaven </i>and <i>The Map of Heaven</i> shares his insights into the true nature of consciousness. Embracing his radically new worldview, he began a committed program of personal exploration into nonlocal consciousness.

She is the cofounder of Sacred Acoustics, an innovator in the emerging field of brainwave entrainment audio recordings used to help listeners reach transcendental states of awareness.i n t r o d u c t i o n<br> Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has&nbsp;seen and thinking what nobody has thought.<br> &#x2014;Albert Szent-Gy�rgyi (1893&#x2013;1986), Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1937<br><br> What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Most people do not dwell on this question. It&#x2019;s best to leave such musings up to neuroscientists and philosophers&#x2014;why spend time thinking about such scholarly matters? Brain and mind are clearly related, and that&#x2019;s enough for most of us to know, right? We have more important things to focus on in our lives.<br><br> As a practicing neurosurgeon, I was exposed daily to the mind-brain relationship due to the fact that my patients would often have alterations in their level of consciousness. While this phenomenon was interesting, my focus was pragmatic. I was trained to evaluate those alterations in consciousness in order to diagnose and treat various tumors, injuries, infections, or strokes affecting the brain. We have the tools and, hopefully, the talent to benefit our patients by restoring them to more &#x201c;normal&#x201d; levels of conscious awareness. I closely followed developments in physics and knew there were theories about how it all works, but I had patients to care for, and more important things to consider. <br><br>My complacency with that arrangement of casual &#x201c;understanding&#x201d; came crashing to a halt on November 10, 2008. I collapsed on my bed and fell into a deep coma, after which I was admitted to Lynchburg General Hospital&#x2014;the same hospital where I had worked as a neurosurgeon. While in coma, I experienced things that, in the weeks after awakening, baffled me and cried out for an explanation within the bounds of science as I knew it.<br><br>According to conventional neuroscience, due to the severe damage to my brain caused by an overwhelming bacterial meningoencephalitis, I should not have experienced anything&#x2014;at all! But while my brain was besieged and swollen with infection, I went on a fantastic odyssey during which I remembered nothing of my life on earth. This odyssey seemed to have lasted for months or years, an elaborate journey into many layers of&nbsp;higher dimensions, at times viewed from the perspective of infinity and eternity, outside of space and time. Such a complete inactivation of my neocortex, the outer surface of the brain, should have disabled all but the most rudimentary experiences and memory&#x2014;yet I was haunted by the persistence of so many ultrareal memories, vivid and complex. At first I simply trusted my doctors and their advice that &#x201c;the dying brain can play all kinds of tricks.&#x201d; After all, I had sometimes given my own patients the same &#x201c;advice.&#x201d;<br><br> My final follow-up visit with the main neurologist involved in my care came in early January 2010, fourteen months after awakening from my treacherous weeklong coma. Dr. Charlie Joseph had been a friend and close associate before my coma, and had struggled with the rest of my medical colleagues through the brunt of my horrific meningoencephalitis, recording the details of the neurological devastation along the way. We caught up on the specifics of my recovery (all of which were quite surprising and unexpected, given the severity of my illness during that fateful week), reviewing some of the neurological exams and MRI and CT scan results from my time in coma, and performing a complete neurological examination.<br><br> As tempting as it was to simply accept my extraordinary healing and current well-being as an inexplicable miracle, I couldn&#x2019;t do that. Instead, I was driven to find an explanation for the journey I took during the coma&#x2014;a sensory experience that completely defied our conventional neuroscientific concepts of the role of the neocortex in detailed conscious awareness. The unsettling prospect that fundamental tenets of neuroscience were incorrect led me into deeper territory in my final discussion with Dr. Joseph that blustery winter afternoon.<br><br> &#x201c;I am left with no explanation whatsoever as to how my mental experiences deep in coma, so vibrant, complex, and alive, could have possibly occurred,&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;It seemed more real than anything I had ever experienced.&#x201d; I recounted for him how numerous details clearly placed the vast majority of my coma experience as occurring between days one and five of my seven-day coma, and yet the neurological examinations, lab values, and imaging results all confirmed that my neocortex was too damaged by the severe meningoencephalitis to have supported any such conscious experience. &#x201c;How am I to make any sense of all this?&#x201d; I asked my friend.<br><br> I&#x2019;ll never forget Charlie&#x2019;s smile, as he looked at me with a sense of <i>knowing</i>, and said, &#x201c;There is plenty of room in our understanding of the brain, and mind, and consciousness to allow for this mystery of your remarkable recovery to indicate something of great importance. As you well know, we encounter copious evidence in clinical neurology that we have a far way to go before we can start claiming any kind of &#x2018;complete&#x2019; understanding. I am inclined to accept your personal mystery as another lovely piece of the puzzle, one that greatly raises the ante in approaching any understanding of the nature of our existence. Just enjoy!&#x201d;<br><br> I found it most reassuring that a highly trained and capable neurologist, one who had carefully followed the details of my illness, was open to the grand possibilities implied by my memories from deep in coma. Charlie helped open wide the door that has led to my transformation from a materialist scientist, proud of his academic skepticism, into someone who now knows his true nature and has also been offered a glimpse into levels of reality that is most refreshing, indeed. <br><br>Of course, it was not an easy journey in those initial months of exploration and confusion. I knew that I was entertaining concepts that many in my field would consider beyond the pale, if not outright heretical. Some might even suggest that I let go of my inquiry rather than commit professional suicide by sharing such a radical tale.<br><br>As Dr. Joseph and I had come to agree, my brain was severely damaged by a near-fatal case of bacterial meningoencephalitis. The neocortex&#x2014;the part modern neuroscience tells us must be at least partially active for conscious experience&#x2014;was incapable of creating or processing anything even remotely close to what I experienced. And yet I did experience it. To quote Sherlock Holmes, &#x201c;When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&#x201d; Thus, I had to&nbsp;accept the improbable: This very real experience happened, and I was conscious of it&#x2014;and my consciousness did not depend on having an intact brain. Only by allowing my mind (and my heart) to open as widely as possible was I able to see the cracks in the conventional consensus view&nbsp;of the brain and consciousness. It was by the light allowed in by those cracks that I began to glimpse the true depths of the mind-body debate.<br><br> That debate is of extreme importance to us all because many of our foundational assumptions about the nature of reality hinge on the directions in which that debate flows. Any notion of meaning and purpose in our existence, of connection with others and the universe, of our very sense of free will, and even of such concepts as an afterlife and reincarnation&#x2014;all of these deep issues depend directly on the outcome of the mind-body debate. The relationship between mind and brain is thus one of the most profound and important mysteries in all of human thought. And the picture emerging from the most advanced reaches of scientific investigation is quite contrary to our conventional scientific viewpoint. A revolution in understanding appears imminent.<br><br> This pathway of discovery continues to unfold, and will no doubt occupy me for the rest of my life. Along the way I have encountered some of the most expansive experiences and intriguing people I could possibly imagine. I have learned not to be seduced by simplistic falsehoods about an assumed world, but to strive to assess and deal with the world as it truly is. As human beings seeking a deeper understanding of our existence, we are all well served to take that approach to heart.<br><br> During the Deepest anD most perplexing phases in the nine years since I&nbsp;first awakened from coma, my mantra has often been, &#x201c;Believe in it all, at least for now.&#x201d; My advice to you, dear reader, is to do the same&#x2014;suspend disbelief for now, and open your mind as broadly as possible.

Now, although a host of scientific discoveries prove this wrong, a mindset of limits persists, blocking us from our greatest possibilities and leaving us feeling bombarded by stress, change, and uncertainty. No matter how hard we work, no matter how much we give, we're still not getting what we hoped for. There is another way.<br><br>Dr. Robert Cooper, a neuroscience pioneer and leadership advisor, urges us to take a radically different view of human capacity. We are mostly unused potential, he says, employing less than 10 percent of our brilliance or hidden talents. In easy-to-follow steps, he explains how to develop and apply the art and science of your hidden capacity.<br><br>The art is the motivation and inspiration coming from the wonderful stories that are the heart of <b>The Other 90%</b>. Dr. Cooper draws on his wide-ranging insights and experiences to show how it's possible to make a difference in yourself and others.<br><br>However, inspiration without a way to turn vision into reality is an empty vessel. Combining art with science, Dr. Cooper provides extraordinary help in the form of specific, little-known practical ways to use the latest research in neuroscience, performance psychology, and work physiology for excelling in a pressure-filled world. He shows you how to:<br><br>* Increase energy at work -- and have more energy for personal and family life.<br><br>* Activate the brain's "alertness switches" to defeat pressure and stress.<br><br>* Use not only the brain in your head but the ones in your heart and gut.<br><br>* Motivate exceptional ingenuity and performance in yourself and others.<br><br>The most exciting breakthroughs will not come from advances in technology but from a deeper realization of what it means to be most human and alive. Many of the choices that can dramatically change our lives are simple and practical -- yet few people know what these choices are or how to apply them in work and life. <b>The Other 90%</b> is your guide to new territory and new challenges.</p><p>Some 10-to-90-percent splits are good, like giving one-tenth of what you make to those less fortunate or putting 10 percent of it into a smart saving plan. Others are bad, like being a miserly 10-percent tipper or using only that tiny portion of the capabilities of your powerful computer software. Worst of all is the fact that most of us use only 10 percent of our intelligence and creativity potential, leaving vast quantities of what we're capable lying dormant, unused and untapped. It's this ratio that Robert Cooper hopes to help reverse with <i>The Other 90%</i>, his inspirational guide to waking the sleeping giant within each of us.<p> Cooper groups his observations and advice under four keystones: trust, energy, farsightedness, and nerve. In a diagram at the beginning, he illustrates each of these keystones with insights quoted from an unusual mixture of literary and political figures, setting the tone for a book that mixes tales of the famous with those of the unknown and moments of ordinary life with the eureka moments of exceptional triumphs. He promotes trust in its broadest sense, such as incorporating and blending all three streams of intelligence (brain, heart, and gut) into decision making, and trusting oneself enough to escape the trap of comparison. He shares simple suggestions for cultivating calm energy, so as to be quick and effective without rushing, and encourages readers to learn the difference between the trivia in life that counts (and drains us of precious energy) and that which doesn't. Being farsighted, for Cooper, is essentially learning to align more of your actions--and ultimately your life--with your biggest dreams. And nerve is the art of developing a thick skin and making adversity your ally on the road to achieving those hopes and ambitions.</p><p> <i>The Other 90%</i> suffers a bit from the problem of many inspirational books, being so densely packed with anecdotes that the good advice is sometimes lost in a blur of well-intentioned examples. Indeed, some of Cooper's most profound comments leap out of the least elaborate stories, such as the memory of his grandfather gazing at Sirius, one of the brightest but most distant stars, and explaining that he did this "because it draws my gaze the farthest away from where I'm standing right now." But Cooper's enthusiasm is timely; the accepted notion that we only use one-tenth of our capabilities was revised a few years ago by studies indicating we only use one ten-thousandth. So there's room for all kinds of improvement. --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p>"A beautifully inspirational and truly insightful leadership book for the digital age!"<br>-- Stephen R.

Giraffes!</h2><p><p>For many years the scientific and educational communities have wondered and worried about the possibility that semi-sane scholar-pretenders would find the means to publish a series of reference books aimed at children but filled with ludicrous misinformation. These books would be distributed through respectable channels and would inevitably find their ways into the hands and households of well-meaning families, who would go to them for facts but instead find bizarre untruths. The books would look normal enough, but would read as if written by people who have eaten too many lead-based paint chips. <i>Giraffes? Giraffes!</i> is the first in a proposed series of 377 reference books, all written by a couple now getting their chance to twist and tickle the brains of the impressionable. The book puts forth the following novel theories: that giraffes were not part of any evolutionary chain, but came here from Neptune, by way of very long (but convenient and fast) escalators; that giraffes are expert dancers, but become angry if asked about their dancing; that giraffes control over 90 percent of what we see in mirrors; and that the Giraffe navy is as strong as ever, contrary to recent claims in the popular press.</p></p><p>Dr Doris Haggis-On-Whey has 17 degrees from 18 institutions of higher learning.

An unusual piece of cheese. Made from an old family recipe, Ambrosio&#x2019;s cheese was reputed to be among the finest in the world, and was said to hold mystical qualities. Eating it, some claimed, conjured long-lost memories. But then, Ambrosio said, things had gone horribly wrong. . . .<br><br> By the time the two men exited the telling room that evening, Paterniti was hooked. Soon he was fully embroiled in village life, relocating his young family to Guzm�n in order to chase the truth about this cheese and explore the fairy tale&#x2013;like place where the villagers conversed with farm animals, lived by an ancient Castilian code of honor, and made their wine and food by hand, from the grapes growing on a nearby hill and the flocks of sheep floating over the Meseta.<br><br> What Paterniti ultimately discovers there in the highlands of Castile is nothing like the idyllic slow-food fable he first imagined. Instead, he&#x2019;s sucked into the heart of an unfolding mystery, a blood feud that includes accusations of betrayal and theft, death threats, and a murder plot. As the village begins to spill its long-held secrets, Paterniti finds himself implicated in the very story he is writing.<br><br> Equal parts mystery and memoir, travelogue and history, <i>The Telling Room </i>is an astonishing work of literary nonfiction by one of our most accomplished storytellers. A moving exploration of happiness, friendship, and betrayal, <i>The Telling Room</i> introduces us to Ambrosio Molinos de las Heras, an unforgettable real-life literary hero, while also holding a mirror up to the world, fully alive to the power of stories that define and sustain us.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Telling Room</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;Captivating . . . Paterniti&#x2019;s writing sings, whether he&#x2019;s talking about how food activates memory, or the joys of watching his children grow.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;NPR</b><i><br></i></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, August 2013:</strong> The premise sounds far-fetched, even a little silly: While proofreading a deli catalog in Michigan, Michael Paterniti is bewitched by a description of cave-aged Spanish cheese; years later, disillusioned with modern life and his own &#x201c;computer-soft hands,&#x201d; he travels to its Spanish back-country source, where he becomes obsessed with its larger-than-life maker and his story of soul-stealing cheese-related betrayal. But don&#x2019;t get too cynical (or annoyed by the sprawling footnotes) too fast, or you&#x2019;ll miss the earth-stained magic of this story. Yes, Paterniti can be a hyperbolic virtuoso, &#x201c;given to tilting the most quotidian events into a Viking epic&#x201d;--or a Castillian tragedy. He even opens with this quote from Pascal: &#x201c;Imagination magnifies small objects with fantastic exaggeration until they fill our soul.&#x201d; But these &#x201c;small objects,&#x201d; en masse, do become soul-filling until Paterniti&#x2019;s life-altering epiphany in a moonlit field of sunflowers seems like an essential human experience.

How can we talk about the Resurrection today? Gerhard Lohfink takes up the question of death and resurrection in this new book. He argues against the dazzling array of today&#39;s ideas and expectations and seeks his answers in Scripture, the Christian tradition, and human reason. With his characteristically gentle but clear language, he reveals the power of Christian resurrection, showing it is not about events that lie in the distant future but rather occurrences incomprehensively close to us. They were long since begun and they will embrace us fully in our own death..</p><p><p>Gerhard Lohfink was professor of New Testament exegesis at the University of T�bingen. Since 1986, he has lived and worked as a theologian for the Catholic Integrated Community. His many books include&nbsp;<i>No Irrelevant Jesus</i>, <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>, <i>Does God Need the Church?,</i>&nbsp;<i>Is This All There Is?</i>, and <i>The Our Father</i>, all from Liturgical Press.</p><p></p><p></p>"Thoughtful, entertaining . . . Asking big religious questions Lohfink takes aim at classic discussions of faith from a Christian perspective rooted in wonder and trust. This intelligent, gracious book is a welcome contribution to theological conversations about life, death, and resurrection."<i>Publishers Weekly</i> Starred Review<br><br>"This is exactly what one expects from Lohfink, the distinguished biblical scholar and respected theologian: a book that is hugely informed, consistently provocative, conscientiously pastoral, and&#x2014;in the best sense of the word&#x2014;imaginative."Dale C. Allison Jr., Princeton Theological Seminary, author of <i>Night Comes: Death, Imagination, and the Last Things </i><br><br>"If you are planning to read this book, prepare for an exhilarating and surprising ride. Lohfink leads us through all the imaginable possibilities of what happens to us when we die and then moves to a most profound description of what our faith teaches us. This is a book that must be read at least twice. Also take time to enjoy Linda Maloney's excellent translation."Irene Nowell, OSB, author of <i>Wisdom: The Good Life</i><br><br>"Gerhard Lohfink's <i>Is This All There Is?</i> is an extraordinarily clear, well-argued, and thoroughly engaging book. Beginning with a discussion of basic human questions about the meaning of life and death, Lohfink explores Christian beliefs in dialogue with other religious and nonreligious perspectives. Undergraduates will find this book accessible and thought-provoking, while the nuance of Lohfink's analysis will challenge theological experts to reconsider their views. I know of no better overview of Christian eschatology and would encourage its use at all levels."Mary Doak, Associate Professor of Theology and Religious Studies, University of San Diego<br><br>"Gerhard Lohfink's I<i>s This All There Is?</i> is a stunningly original, profound, and spiritually uplifting and challenging book. Three things stand out in it. First, we cannot validly use our notions of space and time when we talk about life after death. There is a purification process but seeing purgatory as a space like ours and reckoning time in the process as we do on earth is profoundly mistaken. Second, eternal life and resurrection is a pure gift from God. We share in the resurrection of Jesus, the firstborn from the dead. Finally, we need to juxtapose God's justice and his mercy. Excellent chapters deal with our caring for the dying and preparing for our own deaths. It is also a very well-written book."John A. Coleman, Casassa Professor Emeritus at Loyola Marymount University, Associate Pastor at Saint Ignatius Parish, San Francisco<br><br>"Highly recommend this book as a profound invitation to reflect on the ultimate issues of death and life."<i>Theological Studies</i><br><br>"Gerhard Lohfink has given us a splendid book: biblically grounded, theologically astute, spiritually concrete and challenging. In a style that is limpid, poetic, and personal, he leads the reader deeper into the mystery of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection and to a renewed sense of the hope that is in all who believe in the risen Christ. Lohfink's work wonderfully rekindles Christian eschatological faith and imagination."Robert Imbelli, Associate professor emeritus, Boston College, author of <i>Rekindling the Christic Imagination</i><br><br>"Addressing a broad audience with clear pastoral concern, Gerhard Lohfink admits that the questions which he raises in this volume are his own as well. He brings not only a wealth of biblical and theological sources, but also poetry, literature, science, and his own creative speculation to bear on the ultimate question which faces us all: <i>Is This All There Is?</i> Confronted with the stark reality of two possibilities&#x2014;nothingness or radical hope&#x2014;Lohfink centers his reflections on the Christian conviction that in the resurrection of Jesus, God's final `new creation' has already begun. Grounded in that hope he invites his readers to consider what it means to live with and in Christ&#x2014;not only in the future, but here and now. This text is provocative, passionate, and pastoral&#x2014;a rare combination and a volume well worth pondering."Mary Catherine Hilkert, OP, Professor of Theology, University of Notre Dame</p><h2>Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1918</h2><p>On April 24, 1915, Grigoris Balakian was arrested along with some 250 other leaders of Constantinople&#x2019;s Armenian community. It was the beginning of the Ottoman Empire&#x2019;s systematic attempt to eliminate the Armenian people from Turkey&#x2014;a campaign that continued through World War I and the fall of the empire. Over the next four years, Balakian would bear witness to a seemingly endless caravan of blood, surviving to recount his miraculous escape and expose the atrocities that led to over a million deaths.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Armenian Golgotha</i> is Balakian&#x2019;s devastating eyewitness account&#x2014;a haunting reminder of the first modern genocide and a controversial historical document that is destined to become a classic of survivor literature.</p><p>Born in 1876, <b>Grigoris Balakian</b> was one of the leading Armenian intellectuals of his generation. In Ottoman Turkey he attended Armenian schools and seminary; and in Germany he studied, at different times, engineering and theology. He was one of the 250 cultural leaders (intellectuals, clergy, teachers, and political and community leaders) arrested by the Turkish government on the night of April 24, 1915, and deported to the interior. Unlike the vast majority of his conationals, he survived nearly four years in the killing fields. Ordained as a celibate priest (<i>vartabed</i>) in 1901, he later became a bishop and prelate of the Armenian Apostolic Church in southern France. He is the author of various books and monographs (some of them lost) on Armenian culture and history, including <i>The Ruins of Ani</i> (1910) and <i>Armenian Golgotha</i>, volume 1 (1922) and volume 2 (1959).

Grigoris Balakian was his great-uncle.<b><br></b>The Night of GethsemaneOn the night of Saturday, April 11/24, 1915, the Armenians of the capital city, exhausted from the Easter celebrations that had come to an end a few days earlier, were snoring in a calm sleep. Meanwhile on the heights of Stambul, near Ayesofia, a highly secret activity was taking place in the palatial central police station.Groups of Armenians had just been arrested in the suburbs and neighborhoods of the capital; blood-colored military buses were now transporting them to the central prison. Weeks earlier Bedri,* chief of police in Constantinople, had sent official sealed orders to all the guardhouses, with the instruction that they not be opened until the designated day and that they then be carried out with precision and in secrecy. The orders were warrants to arrest the Armenians whose names were on the blacklist, a list compiled with the help of Armenian traitors, particularly Artin Megerdichian, who worked with the neighborhood Ittihadclubs.&#x2020; Condemned to death were Armenians who were prominent and active in either revolutionary or nonpartisan Armenian organizations and who were deemed liable to incite revolution or resistance.&#x2021;On this Saturday night I, along with eight friends from Scutari, was transported by a small steamboat from the quay of the huge armory of Selimiye to Sirkedji. The night smelled of death; the sea was rough, and our hearts were full of terror. We prisoners were under strict police guard, not allowed to speak to one another. We had no idea where we were going.We arrived at the central prison, and here behind gigantic walls and large bolted gates, they put us in a wooden pavilion in the courtyard, which was said by some to have once served as a school. We sat there, quiet and somber, on the bare wooden floor under the faint light of a flickering lantern, too stunned and confused to make sense of what was happening.We had barely begun to sink into fear and despair when the giant iron gates of the prison creaked open again and a multitude of new faces were pushed inside. They were all familiar faces&#x2014;revolutionary and political leaders, public figures, and nonpartisan and even antipartisan intellectuals.From the deep silence of the night until morning, every few hours Armenians were brought to the prison. And so behind these high walls, the jostling and commotion increased as the crowd of prisoners became denser. It was as if all the prominent Armenian public figures&#x2014;assemblymen, representatives, revolutionaries, editors, teachers, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, merchants, bankers, and others in the capital city&#x2014;had made an appointment to meet in these dim prison cells. Some even appeared in their nightclothes and slippers. The more those familiar faces kept appearing, the more the chatter abated and our anxiety grew.Before long everyone looked solemn, our hearts heavy and full of worry about an impending storm. Not one of us understood why we had been arrested, and no one could assess the consequences. As the night&#x2019;s hours slipped by, our distress mounted. Except for a few rare stoics, we were in a state of spiritual anguish, terrified of the unknown and longing for comfort.Right through till morning new Armenian prisoners arrived, and each time we heard the roar of the military cars, we hurried to the windows to see who they were. The new arrivals had contemptuous smiles on their faces, but when they saw hundreds of other well-known Armenians old and young around them, they too sank into fear. We were all searching for answers, asking what all of this meant, and pondering our fate.*See Biographical Glossary.&#x2020;Meeting places for members of the local Ittihad Party committees throughout the empire.&#x2014;trans.&#x2021;Revolutionary here refers to reform-oriented political workers.&#x2014;trans.</p><h2>Falling Angel (The Falling Angel Novels)</h2><p><b>Edgar Award Finalist: The hunt for a vanished singer leads a detective into the depths of the occult in this &#x201c;terrific&#x201d; novel (Stephen King).</b><br> &nbsp;Big-band frontman Johnny Favorite was singing for the troops when a Luftwaffe fighter squadron strafed the bandstand, killing the crowd and leaving the singer near death.

It revolutionizes scholarship on the factors underlying government and popular movements toward democracy or dictatorship. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources.

Unfortunately, Arendt lived to complete only the first two parts, <i>Thinking</i> and <i>Willing</i>. Of the third, <i>Judging</i>, only the title page, with epigraphs from Cato and Goethe, was found after her death. As the titles suggest, Arendt conceived of her work as roughly parallel to the three <i>Critiques</i> of Immanuel Kant. In fact, while she began work on <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, Arendt lectured on "Kant's Political Philosophy," using the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> as her main text.

It has influenced political theorists and social reformers, as well as Victorian home d�cor and contemporary fashion. This <em>Very Short</em> <em>Introduction</em> captures the history of the Gothic from ancient times to the present. It covers the sack of Rome by the barbarian tribes, mediaeval architecture, popular culture in the sixteenth century (including ballads and Revenge Tragedy), political theories of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the rise of the Gothic novel, the Victorian Gothic Revival, and the influence of Gothic culture on film, music, and fashion. It includes familiar Gothic novels such <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Dracula</em>, while also covering Gothic gardening, slasher movies, and the current Goth scene. It is the only account of the Gothic that describes the entire history of the term, presenting it in all its richly complex and perversely contradictory glory.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nick Groom</strong> is Chair in English at the University of Exeter, and Director of ECLIPSE: the Exeter Centre for Literatures of Identity, Place, and Sustainability.

The time for restraint is over.<br><br>Kate is naive about a lot of things, but she knows what Jacob is offering, and it isn&#x2019;t forever. And yet she&#x2019;s been in love with him for as long as she can remember.

Jacob Cade had never mixed well. He might have his share of adoring women, thanks to his sizable fortune, but he seemed to treat everyone with the same impartial contempt. He was quietly standing there, his dark gaze glancing toward the road where his niece was due to arrive any minute. And despite his indifference to the crowd, he drew women's eyes. He was darkly tanned and rugged, his powerful legs outlined by the superb fit of his trousers, his broad shoulders straining against the fabric of his suit coat. His hands were lean and dark, and there were no rings on them. Jacob wasn't a sentimental man. He was an old-fashioned reactionary in everything from dress to attitudes, and he made no apologies for it. He didn't have to. He had enough money to make up his own rules as he went along.<br><br>"Lord of all he surveys," Kate muttered, glaring.<br><br>"Isn't he entitled?" Tom, her brother, laughed softly. "He's got enough fluttering female hearts in his pocket. Including yours..."<br><br>"Hush!" she bit off, nibbling on her lower lip.<br><br>"He doesn't know," he mused, glancing down at her. They were both tall, dark-haired and green-eyed. Although Tom, at twenty-eight, was four years her senior, they might well have been twins for the resemblance of their facial features. The same even, etched features highlighted both high-cheekboned faces, the faint remnants of a Sioux great-grandfather.<br><br>"I hate him," Kate said firmly, pushing a strand of hair back into the elegant French knot she'd twisted her long, straight hair into that morning.<br><br>"Sure you do."<br><br>"I do," she insisted. And at that moment, she really did. Jacob's sudden, violent dislike for her, which stemmed from an incident when Kate was eighteen, had put a severe strain on her friendship with Margo. It was odd, too, because Jacob had been good to the family when Kate was younger.<br><br>Kate and Tom had been adopted by their paternal grandmother after the death of their father. God alone knew where their mother was. She'd deserted them years before, and Kate had never stopped blaming her. The children had been badly scarred by the way their father had brought them up. Not even Grandmother Walker had known what they'd been through, because she hadn't been the kind of person who invited confidences. But she'd taken them into her home in Blairsville, South Dakota, just minutes from Pierre, the capital. Margo Cade had lived with her uncle Jacob Cade and his father, Hank, on Warlance since the unexpected death of her parents years before. When Kate and Tom Walker had come to Blairsville to live with their Grandmother Walker, the girls had become friends. They'd spent time at each other's houses since early high school. Now Margo was marrying, and although Kate had declined the honor of being a participant in the wedding, she couldn't get out of attending. Not even to spite Jacob Cade.<br><br></p><h2>How to Use Yoga: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Iyengar Method of Yoga for Relaxation, Health and Well-Being Shown in 450 Photographs</h2><p>With over 425,000 copies sold, How to Use Yoga demystifies that art of yoga, making it accessible to everyone who would like to start to practice at home, safely and effectively.

Chance brings the Black to the hidden island home of the giant red stallion, Flame. Such a small island can only support one alpha male. But before the two can fight&#x2013;a fight that can only result in the death of one&#x2013;a new danger appears. Together, can the stallions defeat the deadly foe which threatens the lives of the entire herd of wild horses?</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.Like a giant bat the transatlantic plane flew through the night, using sensitive antennas to find its way. There was no beauty of flight, only a boiling turbulence that obliterated the stars high above and the sea down below. Red, white and green lights sought hopelessly to pierce the murk, blinking on and off. The four straining engines spoke loudly in defiance of the elements as driving rain pelted the plane's aluminum skin.<br><br> The wind grew stronger, spewing rain with explosive force against glass and metal. The engines labored a little more and the night grew blacker still. Suddenly the plane lurched, its wings slicing thickly through the heavy air. It righted itself and for a moment more held a steady course, then it shuddered again as if the weight of the air mass had become too great to bear. The pitch of its propellers changed, urgently straining, pounding, seeking to thrust the plane forward and upward.<br><br> The storm fought back viciously, changing rain to sleet and hail, pummeling the plane with boiling white ice and seeking to beat it down. Beneath this attack the plane was forced to descend. In the lower air there was relief from the icy blows.<br><br> But the storm did not leave it alone for long. Lightning stabbed the sky and shattered the blackness. Suddenly the plane lurched again. It was bathed in a weird light and there seemed to be a ball of fire on its nose. Propellers became whirling wheels of green vapor. What seemed like huge balloons of red, blue and green exploded everywhere in the heavens, and storm clouds took on ever-changing, fiery shapes.<br><br> Directly in the center of this beautiful but frightening spectral light the plane flew unharmed. It could now be seen clearly and the name on its side read Bermuda Atlantic Transport. On its vertical tail fin were the large initials:<br><br> B<br><br> A<br><br> T<br><br> There was nothing soft about this plane or the men flying it. Together they'd made one hundred and twenty-six trips across the South Atlantic--from Portugal to the Cape Verde Islands, on to Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Bermuda and then, if the cargo payload warranted it, to New York.<br><br> The red linoleum floor of the flight deck heaved beneath the seats of the crew and the captain said, "A couple more jolts like the last one and we'll end up in the drink for sure." His eyes didn't leave the shaking instrument panel with its blurred figures.<br><br> Strapped in the seat to the captain's right was the copilot, his hands, too, on the control yoke trying to keep the plane steady. "I can take jolts better than the fire," he said. "I don't like it. I never did."<br><br> "Harmless. If all we had to worry about was St. Elmo's fire we'd be sitting fine."<br><br> "I know, but I still don't like it," the copilot said. "But, baby, just as long as the fans keep turning . . ." He didn't finish his sentence, nor did he bother to look in the direction of the propellers. There was nothing on the other side of the windows anyway but swirling darkness. The fire--a discharge of electricity combined with sleeting rain--was gone.<br><br> "She won't let us down," the captain said confidently. "Not this girl." He patted the leather crash pad above the panel. "We've been going steady too long."<br><br> For a moment the propellers bit smoothly into the night air and the plane leveled off. The needles no longer danced crazily on the green dials so the captain took one hand at a time off the control wheel and wiped his palms dry. An airman expected all kinds of weather, but nothing like this, the captain thought, without some briefing before departure. The forecaster in the Cape Verde weather room had prophesied a little light rain, headwinds of forty miles on the nose and Trinidad clear. Nothing out of the ordinary; in fact it was quite a good forecast for the South Atlantic at this time of year. The captain had known weathermen to be wrong before but never so completely wrong as this one!<br><br> The plane plunged down sickeningly into an air pocket. Two pairs of hands sought urgently to pull the nose up again. Winds screamed through the antennas, propellers groaned and there was a grinding jolt as the plane hit a lower cloud bank before leveling off again.<br><br> The captain worked the controls, straining to compensate for the swirling winds. He eyed the gauges, especially the altimeter. On his next trip he'd walk into the Cape Verde weather room and tell that forecaster exactly what he thought of him! But now all he could do was to ride out this storm.<br><br> The copilot worked as hard as the captain. He advanced the throttles, keeping all four engines equal in power. "Fans, keep turning," he pleaded, "keep turning!" They were burning over two hundred gallons of gasoline an hour. He looked at the gyrocompass, its spinning needle turning in every direction but toward their initial course. He took a second more to check the time on the black-faced panel clock. How much gas was left? And where were they anyway? It was their navigator's job to know, but the copilot was too busy to turn to him now and ask. As close as he could figure it they had fuel for about two more hours.<br><br> Suddenly the hail and lightning came on again, beating and burning the aluminum skin.<br><br> The captain's legs were numb from working the worn rubber pedals; his eyes were bloodshot from the constant strain of watching the white dancing needles on the panel; his insides groaned from the beating they were taking on this crazy, bouncing deck; and his arms felt like pieces of lead. But at least the plane was still in the air.</p><h2>Colorado Cleanse 4.0: 14-Day Ayurvedic Digestive Detox and Lymph Cleanse with Seasonal Cookbook</h2><p>The restructured and expanded Colorado Cleanse + Seasonal Cookbook is now available!

Her journey from resisting her design to embracing it with joy is a faithful guide for young Christian women wondering what to make of being female. In a day when <em>male</em> and <em>female</em> are seen as too confining, when it is said that gender is best bent to the whims of our personal expression, Reissig faithfully shows why being made female, in the image of God, is an exceedingly good gift.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Candice Watters, </strong>Cofounder, Boundless.org; author, <em>Get Married: What Women Can Do to Help It Happen</em></p></p><h2>Nice Dragons Finish Last (Heartstrikers)</h2><p>As the smallest dragon in the Heartstriker clan, Julius survives by a simple code: keep quiet, don&#x2019;t cause trouble, and stay out of the way of bigger dragons.

In truth, he was &#x201c;low in stature, and of a weakly constitution,&#x201d; a small man who was often sickly and afflicted with doubts and fears. In<i> The Mighty Weakness of John Knox</i>, a new Long Line Profile from Reformation Trust Publishing, author Douglas Bond shows that Knox did indeed accomplish herculean tasks, but not because he was strong and resolute in himself. Rather, he was greatly used because he was submissive to God; therefore, God strengthened him. That strength was displayed as Knox endured persecution and exile, faced down the wrath of mighty monarchs, and prayed, preached, and wrote with no fear of man, but only a desire to manifest the glory of God and to please Him.</p><p>For those who see themselves as too weak, too small, too timid, or simply too ordinary for service in God&#x2019;s kingdom, Knox&#x2019;s life offers a powerful message of hope&#x2015;the biblical truth that God often delights to work most powerfully through people who are most weak in themselves but most strong in Him.</p></p><p>John Knox, the great Reformer of Scotland, the man who once was a slave in a French galley but rose to stand against powerful queens, was a small man, often ill, and frequently filled with fears and doubts. How did one so weak in body and mind accomplish so much? <p> The answer, Douglas Bond shows, is that Knox was strong in spirit, for he was submissive to the will of God and cared more for the glory of Christ than his own. God strengthened him in his submission to do far more than he could have accomplished in his own power. </p><p> For those who see themselves as too weak, too small, too timid, or simply too ordinary for service in God's kingdom, Knox's life offers a powerful message of hope the biblical truth that God often delights to work most powerfully through people who are most weak in themselves but most strong in Him.</p>Douglas Bond is the head of the English Department and a longtime teacher at Covenant High School, a classical Christian school in Tacoma, Wash.

In <i>Last of the Amazons</i>, Pressfield has surpassed himself, re-creating a vanished world in a brilliant novel that will delight his loyal readers and bring legions more to his singular and powerful restoration of the past. <br><br>In the time before Homer, the legendary Theseus, King of Athens (an actual historical figure), set sail on a journey that brought him into the land of <i>tal Kyrte</i>, the &#x201c;free people,&#x201d; a nation of proud female warriors whom the Greeks called &#x201c;Amazons.&#x201d; The Amazons, bound to each other as lovers as well as fighters, distrusted the Greeks, with their boastful talk of &#x201c;civilization.&#x201d; So when the great war queen Antiope fell in love with Theseus and fled with the Greeks, the mighty Amazon nation rose up in rage. <br> <br><i>Last of the Amazons</i> is not merely a masterful tale of war and revenge. Pressfield has created a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters, from the unforgettable Selene, whose surrender to the Greeks does nothing to tame her; to her lover, Damon, an Athenian warrior who grows to cherish the wild Amazon ways; to the narrator, Bones, a young girl from a noble family who was nursed by Selene from birth and secretly taught the Amazon way; to the great Theseus, the tragic king; and to Antiope, the noble queen who betrayed <i>tal Kyrte</i> for the love of Theseus. <br><br>With astounding immediacy and extraordinary attention to military detail, Pressfield transports readers into the heat and terror of war. Equally impressive is his creation of the Amazon nation, its people, its rituals and myths, its greatness and savagery. <i>Last of the Amazons</i> is thrilling on every page, an epic tale of the clash between wildness and civilization, patriotism and love, man and woman.</p><p>With an epic scope and keen sense of detail, Steven Pressfield has created an entertaining and vital reimagining of the Amazon legend with his historical novel, <i>Last of the Amazons</i>. Combining myth with history, Pressfield offers a conjectural account of the legendary female warrior tribe as it may have existed in the years leading up to its extinction. Following the Athenian-Amazon war in the fifth century B.C., Amazon warrior Selene is taken captive and placed as an unlikely governess to the two daughters of a high-ranking Greek. The three form a lasting bond, and when Selene eventually escapes to return to Amazonia, eldest daughter Europa follows her. The Athenians, including King Theseus, assemble a group to find them, eventually traveling to Amazonia. Here, those involved relate the story of the Amazon war to the men, and the book's action really begins. Narrators tell of Theseus's earlier voyage to Amazonia, where his weakened crew was given shelter by the Amazons; the love affair between Theseus and Amazon queen Antiope; and the terrible consequences of the queen's defection and the Amazonian invasion of Athens that it inspired.<p> Throughout, Pressfield instills <i>Amazons</i> with a grandiose sensibility, firmly modeling it after the Homeric epics of its time. Pressfield relishes in describing these events and their heroes with a divinely consequential spirit:</p><p> </p><blockquote> Antiope advanced...Clearly no few of the foe took her for a goddess, with such splendor did her armor gleam and by such brilliance did her aspect exceed the common measure of humanity. The hour was still early, the west-facing slope deep in shadow, so that the Amazon, seen from the besiegers&#x2019; lines, advanced from gloom into flares of blinding dazzle. </blockquote> <p> Some clumsy dialogue and clich�d interactions hamper the book&#x2019;s emotional resonance, but the level of intricacy and constant action on display here keep the pages moving along. <i>Amazon</i> is ultimately an impressive, fun read that renders history spectacular in its speculation. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>&#x201c;Writing historical fiction that transports you to another time and place is no easy feat, but in <i>Last of the Amazons</i>, Steven Pressfield does just that. He makes the distant past seem real and immediate. This is historical fiction elevated to the status of myth.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Daniel Silva, author of <i>The English Assassin<br></i></p><h2>The Only Book of Wiccan Spells You&#39;ll Ever Need</h2><p><b>Master the fundamentals of spellcraft</b><br><br>Written by noted Wiccan authorities <b>Marian Singer</b>, <b>Trish MacGregor</b>, and <b>Skye Alexander</b>, this collection of spells is perfect for understanding the basics of Wiccan philosophy and ideology.

It strikes without warning: when you are crossing the street, stacking the dishwasher, jogging, whacking a golf ball, lifting a baby, swatting a fly, carrying groceries, bending over, getting out of a car, or just turning on a faucet.<br> <br>Now you&#x2019;re afraid to move. You&#x2019;re locked in place. You feel a belt of pain pulsing across your back from hip to hip. You wonder, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening? What did I do to get this?&#x201d; You feel as though you&#x2019;re cut in half, as the pain seems to separate you from your legs. &#x201c;Will the pain go away? Will it stay?&#x201d; Gingerly, you start to move, but the pain only strikes harder. No, it&#x2019;s not going away, not at all. And if&#x2014;this is a big &#x201c;if&#x201d;&#x2014;the pain does ease off in a few days or go away in a couple of weeks, studies show that over time, it is certain to return in close to 50 percent of patients.<br> <br>Back pain can be your personal bully. It can readily become chronic, lasting for months, years, even a lifetime. It may become so intense and disabling that your life can change dramatically for the worse. It can strip you bare financially, isolate you from family and friends, and leave you anxious and depressed. It can banish even the mere thought of sex. The curious thing about pain is that the more you think about it, the worse it becomes. Preoccupied with your pain, you lose interest in hobbies and sports. Your decreased activity may lead to obesity, which, in turn, can increase your chances of developing diabetes and heart disease. You watch in despair as you decline physically, mentally, and spiritually.<br> <br>This book means exactly what the title End Back Pain Forever says. I have written it so that you can end your back pain once and for all and avoid a life of despair. I say this as a physician who has treated more than ten thousand patients in thirty-five years of private practice and as a past president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the medical society that represents physicians practicing a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of pain.<br> <br>I have seen many patients so wracked by pain that they wished they were dead, and some who actually attempted suicide before they saw me. So I am aware of the helplessness that you and millions like you feel when you first hobble into the doctor&#x2019;s office and exclaim, &#x201c;Doctor, my back is killing me! I can&#x2019;t go on like this!&#x201d;<br> <br>Let me describe a common scenario: after some pokes and prods, the doctor says, &#x201c;Go home, take an aspirin, lie down, and rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>You do as the doctor says. But it does no good, and two days later, having missed work, you see the doctor again. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; says the doctor, &#x201c;you have a case of nonspecific low back pain. We see a great deal of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The diagnosis sounds scientific, but it leaves you completely baffled and still wracked with pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does &#x2018;nonspecific low back pain&#x2019; mean, Doctor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It means that we don&#x2019;t know the cause.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know the cause?&#x201d;<br> <br>Should you ask more, you&#x2019;ll learn that nonspecific low back pain, also known by the acronym NSLBP, is so baffling that the International Association for the Study of Pain devoted an entire chapter to it in Functional Pain Syndromes: Presentation and Pathophysiology, a book for professionals published in 2009. The authors draw the frustrating conclusion that &#x201c;it is exceedingly difficult to identify specific pathology underlying NSLBP.&#x201d; Of course, this is of no help to you or to anyone else.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can put you on strong medication to dull the pain,&#x201d; says the doctor. &#x201c;It may be that your spine is the problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does that mean surgery?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It could. Surgeons do a million spinal operations a year.&#x201d;<br> <br>Surgery on your spine is the last thing you want to do, but your back pain is horrendous. And, of course, you want to get better. So you say, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we do an MRI or a CT scan to see if there&#x2019;s anything wrong with my spine?&#x201d; MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a picture generated by magnetic fields, while a CT (computed tomography) scan is a picture generated by X-rays.<br> <br>When you are shown the test results, the doctor points out that the images of your spine show that you have, say, a herniated disc (in which the cushion between two bony vertebrae is either protruding or has ruptured) or spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spinal column that houses your spinal cord), or some other spinal anomaly&#x2014;and that, apparently, is the cause of your pain.<br> <br>But if it were true that the abnormality on the MRI or CT scan was indeed the cause of your pain, I wouldn&#x2019;t have written this book&#x2014;because almost no one has a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; MRI or CT scan of the lower spine, and what is read as abnormal is frequently not the cause of your pain.<br> <br>That bears repeating: when an MRI shows a herniated disc, it does not necessarily mean that the disc is causing your pain. Many people have a herniated or degenerated disc as a consequence of aging, and yet they have no back pain. Furthermore, it certainly does not mean that surgery is needed.<br> <br>Actually, studies have shown that patients who get imaging tests increase their chance of undergoing an invasive treatment such as surgery or spinal nerve injections. Studies have also shown that when an MRI or CT scan for back pain indicates that something is &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; with the spine, patients are left to believe they will never truly be &#x201c;normal&#x201d; again, regardless of whether their pain is ever reduced or eliminated through any form of treatment. And bear in mind that as many as half of all spinal operations fail.<br> <br>In fact, the primary source of 75 percent or more of all back pain is from the muscles, not the spine. In 2001 a study of more than twenty thousand patients at outpatient medical clinics in the United States found that sprains and strains of muscles and other soft tissue accounted for 70 percent to 80 percent of all back pain. This is strikingly similar to the findings of a study of three thousand patients with back pain conducted at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City in 1946, which revealed that weak and stiff muscles were the source of pain in 83 percent of the participants.<br> <br>It is truly astonishing that so many physicians who treat back pain have failed to make use of these findings. For years, medical schools have paid very little attention to the muscular system, even though muscles account for approximately half the weight of the body. Medical practice in recent decades has relied increasingly on high-tech imagery for diagnosis. Although high-tech imagery is certainly of great value&#x2014;as is surgery, when required&#x2014;neither X-rays nor MRIs nor CT scans are designed to detect the subtle nuances associated with muscle as a source of pain.<br> <br>Take the case of a patient whom I shall call Stephanie. She is a married attorney who in 2004 began to experience stiffness whenever she got up out of a chair. She also had problems straightening up if she bent over. This was bothersome, but it was nothing compared to her first attack of spasms in her low back, on the right side. The spasms were incapacitating. She couldn&#x2019;t walk and had to lie in bed for four days, taking painkillers and muscle relaxants. When the spasms broke, she still felt an inkling of discomfort that would frequently and unexpectedly morph into repeat episodes of painful spasms.<br> <br>It was during one of these crippling occasions that Stephanie went to a major teaching hospital, where an orthopedic surgeon ordered an MRI. The results showed that a disc in her lower spine was flattened, and the surgeon felt that the best treatment for this condition, called degenerative disc disease (DDD), would be a lumbar disc replacement. Stephanie wanted a less aggressive treatment and saw another surgeon, who referred her to a physiatrist (a doctor who treats physical impairments and disabilities). The physiatrist felt that her problem arose from one of the small joints in her spine, known as facet joints, rather than from the DDD. He treated her with injections of a local anesthetic to block the nerve that innervates the facet joint, which relieved some of her pain. Since the nerve block had proved partly successful, Stephanie&#x2019;s doctor suggested that the nerve be &#x201c;turned off&#x201d; temporarily with a procedure known as radiofrequency ablation. The physician would make a small incision in the skin and then use a handheld probe to deliver radio waves to the offending nerve, heating it until it can no longer transmit pain signals. Fearful of tampering with her nerves, Stephanie rejected this option. With no other conventional pain treatment options, and although there was no good indication for it, she agreed to an epidural steroid injection into her lower spine but this was ineffective. Five courses of physical therapy were also unsuccessful, and some of the sessions made her feel worse.<br> <br>Stephanie first saw me in 2006 during one of her periods of muscle spasms. Her pain was so severe that she had been unable to work for two weeks. The pain had spread on this occasion from her right low back to both sides of her back and buttocks, with pain going to her hips and groin and also to her lower legs, feet, and toes. It consisted of a dull ache in her legs and a sense of pressure in the region of her spine. Her family, alarmed by the severity of the attack, urged her to finally have back surgery and &#x201c;get it over with once and for all.&#x201d; Since she needed to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; the &#x201c;damaged&#x201d; disc sometime, why not now?<br> <br>I examined her with an electrical instrument I devised that can identify specific muscles causing pain. This device works by stimulating a specific muscle to contract. If that contraction produces pain, it suggests that that muscle is a source of your pain. Using electrical stimulation, I determined that five muscles in her low back and buttocks were tender. But continued stimulation reduced the pain and actually eliminated it in most of the muscles. This told me that it was her muscles causing the pain, and that it was due to spasms, tension, and stiffness. I treated her with my spasm protocol: electrical stimulation to fatigue the muscle, followed by a different form of electrical stimulation to make the muscle move gently, followed, in turn, by gentle limbering exercises that I will teach you in Chapter 10.<br> <br>After Stephanie&#x2019;s first visit, her pain was reduced by 60 percent. She returned for two additional sessions to relieve the spasm and was taught all twenty-one exercises found in Chapter 10. This brought her total relief. She now does the exercises every day, and four years later remains completely pain free.<br> <br>Stephanie had &#x201c;abnormal&#x201d; findings on her MRI. Nerve blocks to the facet joints of her spine had managed to relieve some of her pain. But with my treatment, she never needed or had a disc replacement or long-term blocking of the nerves that serve her facet joints. She had received a host of well-meaning, costly interventions and suggestions for even more. But all of her pain could have been treated from the start simply, inexpensively, and safely by addressing tense, stiff muscles.<br> <br>Given Stephanie&#x2019;s previous experience with doctors, she well understands the quotation that hangs on my office wall. It is from Eugene Bauer, an internist at the University of Vienna Medical School, who said in 1931, &#x201c;A word in the mouth of a physician is as dangerous as a scalpel in the hands of a surgeon.&#x201d;<br> <br>By showing her the results of X-rays and MRIs, her doctors led her to believe that she was permanently damaged goods. What they saw on the MRI was definitely there. But in her case, as in so many others, the true source of her pain was elsewhere: in her muscles. The truth is that without a muscle examination, we do not have an accurate explanation for your pain or anyone&#x2019;s pain.<br> <br>My professor of anatomy at SUNY Upstate Medical University, Philip Armstrong, MD, used to say, &#x201c;Reiteration without irritation is the essence of good education,&#x201d; and so to repeat the mantra for you: the primary source of 75 percent or more of all back pain is from the muscles, not the spine.</p><h2>The Metaphysical World of Isaac Newton: Alchemy, Prophecy, and the Search for Lost Knowledge</h2><p>Newton&#x2019;s heretical yet equation-incisive writings on theology, spirituality, alchemy, and prophecy, written in secret alongside his <i>Principia Mathematica</i> <br><br>� Shows how Newton&#x2019;s brilliance extended far beyond math and science into alchemy, spirituality, prophecy, and the search for lost continents such as Atlantis <br><br>� Explains how he was seeking to rediscover the one true religion that existed prior to the Flood of Noah, when science and spirituality were one <br><br>� Examines Newton&#x2019;s alternate timeline of prehistory and his study of prophecy through the Book of Revelations, including his prediction of Apocalypse in the year 2060 <br><br>Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is still regarded by the world as the greatest scientist who ever lived. He invented calculus, discovered the binomial theorem, explained the rainbow, built the first reflecting telescope, and explained the force of gravity. In his famous masterpiece, <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, he described the mechanics of the physical universe with unimagined precision, proving the cosmos was put together according to laws. The perfection of these laws implied a perfect legislator. To Newton, they were proof that God existed. <br><br>At the same time Newton was writing <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, he was writing a twin volume that he might have called, had it been completed, <i>Principia Theologia</i>--<i>Principles of Theology</i>. This other masterpiece of Newton, kept secret because of the heresies it contained, consists of thousands of essays providing equation-incisive answers to the spiritual questions that have plagued mankind through the ages. Examining Newton&#x2019;s secret writings, John Chambers shows how his brilliance extended into alchemy, spirituality, the search for lost continents such as Atlantis, and a quest to uncover the &#x201c;corrupted texts&#x201d; that were rife in the Bibles of his time. Although he was a devout Christian, Newton&#x2019;s work on the Bible was focused not on restoring the original Jewish and Christian texts but on rediscovering the one true religion that existed prior to the Flood of Noah, when science and spirituality were one. <br><br>The author shows that a single thread runs through Newton&#x2019;s metaphysical explorations: He is attempting to chart the descent of man&#x2019;s soul from perfection to the present day. The author also examines Newton&#x2019;s alternate timeline of ancient history and his study of prophecy through the Book of Revelations, including his prediction of an Apocalypse in the year 2060 followed by a radically transformed world. He shows that Newton&#x2019;s great hope was that these writings would provide a moral compass for humanity as it embarked upon the great enterprise that became our technological world.</p><p>John Chambers (1939-2017) had a Master of Arts in English degree from the University of Toronto and spent three years at the University of Paris.

After months nervously watching increasingly assertive NATO military posturing, Soviet intelligence agencies in Western Europe received flash telegrams reporting alarming activity on U.S. bases. In response, the Soviets began planning for a countdown to a nuclear first strike by NATO on Eastern Europe.

Through a series of short essays, written in accessible language and a thoroughly engaging style, Anita Sanchez takes the reader on a journey through the natural history of the dandelion and its long association with humans. Joan Jobson s illustrations add important details and subtle accents that enhance this journey. Well adapted ecologically to spread into and thrive within disturbed sites -- such as the lawns, playgrounds, roadsides, and parking lots in which they are most often encountered today, and viewed as weeds -- dandelions also have had a lengthy, welcomed association with humans as medicine, food, and objects of ritual, magic, and folklore. The Teeth of the Lion will be a source of enjoyable, fascinating, memorable information of interest to all users. It will provide naturalists, wildflower enthusiasts, gardeners, interpreters, teachers, landscapers, and homeowners a better understanding of one of the most common, well-known, and perhaps underappreciated plants to be found anywhere.</p><p>Anita Sanchez was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in upstate New York.

However, since the illustrations are clear and realistic and the colors are true, it could be used for color and object identification as well. Starting with a double-page spread of a building with three square windows and a door, the text asks readers to find the bear in the square. A strip on the side gives a clue as to which window is the correct one. The text on the next page asks children to find the two hearts in the queen's hair, and the right-hand strip shows the shape to search for. The book continues through 10 stars in the dark. The shapes include simple ovals and stars but also zigzags, triangles, and crescents. Specific numbers are not mentioned, but youngsters will realize that the quantities of objects are increasing. Some of the illustrations are whimsical such as moons in a cave but others are realistic with balls in a swimming pool and rectangles in a classroom. Therefore, the presentation also offers opportunities to talk about realism versus fantasy.

As he entered the middle period of his career, with volumes such as<i> The Continuous Life</i> (1990), Strand was already well-known for his ability to capture the subtle music of consciousness, and for creating painterly physical landscapes that could answer to the inner self: &#x201c;And here the dark infinitive to feel, / Which would endure and have the earth be still / And the star-strewn night pour down the mountains / Into the hissing fields and silent towns.&#x201d; In his later work, from <i>Blizzard of One </i>(1998) which won the Pulitzer Prize, through the sly, provocative riddles of his recent <i>Almost Invisible</i> (2012), Strand has delighted in reminding us that there is no poet quite like him for a dose of dark wit that turns out to be deep wisdom and self-deprecation. He has given voice to our collective imagination with a grandeur and comic honesty worthy of his great Knopf forebear Wallace Stevens. With this volume, we celebrate his canonical work.</p><p>Mark Strand, born in 1934, was the author of many books of poems, a book of stories, and three volumes of translations, and was the editor of several anthologies. He received many honors and awards, including a MacArthur Fellowship, the Pulitzer Prize (for <i>Blizzard of One</i>), the Bollingen Prize, and the Gold Medal for Poetry from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Girls were just as dirty after all, with thick, sticky makeup and every flavor of perfume clouding the locker rooms. The public high school seemed to have a dim film layered over the lockers and floor, walls and windows. It was the first day back after the winter, so Delilah assumed that everything had been cleaned vigorously over the break, but maybe the fog of girl and boy hormones mixing together had permanently dulled every surface.<br> <br>All around, students pressed past her and lockers slammed near her head, and she struggled to appear unaffected by the public-school chaos. Delilah looked down to the piece of paper clutched in her hand. Before she&#x2019;d even been dressed and fed this morning, her mother had already begun highlighting all of the important information for her: locker number, locker combination, class schedule, teacher names.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should have printed a map for you,&#x201d; Belinda Blue had said as the highlighter squeaked across the page. Delilah had looked away to the neat rows on the carpet left by the vacuum cleaner, had waved politely to her father as he&#x2019;d walked into the kitchen wearing his standard outfit of tan pants, a short-sleeved white collar shirt, and a red tie. Even though he wasn&#x2019;t going to work and maybe didn&#x2019;t even have a job interview today, she couldn&#x2019;t fault him for dressing the part. She, too, was still more comfortable in clothes that resembled her private-school uniform than she was with having this new freedom to wear whatever she wanted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, it&#x2019;s only two main buildings. I can handle it. Saint Ben&#x2019;s had seven.&#x201d;<br> <br>Morton City High was smaller than Saint Benedict&#x2019;s Academy in pretty much every way possible, from the size of the classrooms and number of buildings, to the minds of the student body. Whereas&#x2014;perhaps unexpectedly&#x2014;imagination had been embraced and nurtured in her beautiful Catholic school, there had always been a single way of thinking in her small Kansas hometown, a tendency to embrace normal and disregard anything else in hopes that it might simply go away.<br> <br>It was what had happened to Delilah six years ago, after all. Her parents had tolerated her strangeness with shared looks of exasperation and long-suffering sighs, but then had shipped her off to Massachusetts as soon as an excuse presented itself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Still, you&#x2019;re used to calm. This school is so big and loud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Delilah smiled. When her mother said &#x201c;loud&#x201d; she really meant &#x201c;full of boys.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;ll make it out alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother had given her the look Delilah had seen countless times over winter break&#x2014;the look that said, I&#x2019;m sorry you can&#x2019;t finish your senior year in a fancy school. Please don&#x2019;t tell anyone your father lost his job and your nonna&#x2019;s money is all tied up in her nursing care.<br> <br>The look also said, Be careful of the boys. They have thoughts.<br> <br>Delilah had thoughts too. She had a lot of them, about boys and their arms and smiles and how their throats looked when they swallowed. She had infrequent contact with these things, having been sequestered away for the past several years at an all-girls boarding school, but she certainly had thoughts about them. Unfortunately, the schedule in her hand didn&#x2019;t mention a thing about boys, and instead read: English, Phys Ed, Biology, Organic Chemistry, World Studies, AP French, AP Calculus.<br> <br>She felt her enthusiasm wilt a little before the day had even started. Who wants to have PE so early in the day? She&#x2019;d be a sweaty mop and would never factor into any thoughts anyway.<br> <br>Delilah successfully negotiated her locker combination, stowed some books, and headed to English. The only empty seat in the room&#x2014;Room 104, Mr. Harrington, highlighted in yellow, thank you, Mother&#x2014;was of course in the middle, up front. Delilah was a bull&#x2019;s-eye for the teacher and for the fellow students. But even if she sat in the back of the room, it wouldn&#x2019;t have made a difference: She was a target anyway.<br> <br>Delilah Blue was back from the fancy East Coast boarding school.<br> <br>Delilah Blue had come home to go slumming.<br> <br>Although she spent some of each summer back in Morton, being at school here was different. Delilah had forgotten how many teenagers could come out of the woodwork, and all around her they were yelling, throwing notes, whispering across aisles. Was this how they always behaved while waiting for the teacher? When your time is yours, use it to create something, Father John had always told them. A picture, some words, anything. Don&#x2019;t rot your brain with gossip.<br> <br>Having seen only her best friend, Dhaval, with any sort of regularity&#x2014;and maybe a handful of her classmates around town during breaks&#x2014;Delilah&#x2019;s memories were an old stack of pictures of her eleven-year-old peers. She struggled to place the faces she remembered from six years ago with the reality of the faces now.<br> <br>Rebecca Lewis, her best friend from kindergarten. Kelsey Stiles, her archnemesis in third grade. Both were looking at Delilah as if she&#x2019;d kicked a puppy before class. Rebecca probably glared at her because Delilah had left Morton so successfully. Kelsey probably glared at Delilah for having the gall to come back.<br> <br>Not everyone had been hostile when they recognized Delilah; some girls had greeted her in front of the school with hugs and high-pitched welcomes, and Delilah knew that she had a completely blank slate there. She could be anyone she wanted to be. She didn&#x2019;t have to be the girl whose nervous parents sent her away when she was only eleven for getting into a fistfight defending her unrequited first crush.<br> <br>Delilah took her seat next to Tanner Jones, the only person to ever have beaten her at tetherball in sixth grade, her last year of public school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Delilah,&#x201d; he said, eyes on her legs and then chest and then mouth. Six years ago he&#x2019;d been looking at her pigtails and skinned knees.<br> <br>She smiled to hide her surprise. Delilah hadn&#x2019;t expected the first boy to speak to her to also have thoughts. &#x201c;Hi, Tanner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you had to move back because your dad lost his job at the plant.&#x201d;<br> <br>She kept her smile and stayed quiet, thinking of her mother&#x2019;s innocent-at-best, naive-at-worst hope that people would assume Delilah came home for a single semester for educational purposes, and not because Nonna&#x2019;s well of money had dried up. Clearly the town knew better.<br> <br>Your business is only yours until you share it, Father John had always told them.<br> <br>Just as Mr. Harrington was closing the classroom door, a boy slipped in, mumbling an apology and staring with determination at the floor.<br> <br>Delilah&#x2019;s breath grew trapped in her throat, and the old protective fire flickered to life between her ribs.<br> <br>He was the same, but not. His shirt was black, jeans were black, and shaggy black hair fell into his eyes. He was so tall he must have been pulled like taffy. When he looked up at Delilah as he passed, the same eyes she remembered from all those years ago&#x2014;dark and stormy and shadowed with bluish circles&#x2014;seemed to flicker to life for a moment.<br> <br>Just long enough for her to lose her breath.<br> <br>He looked like he knew every one of her secrets. Who would have guessed that after six years Gavin Timothy would still seem so perfectly dangerous?<br> <br>Apparently, Delilah was still smitten.</p><h2>Living into the Life of Jesus: The Formation of Christian Character</h2><p>Why does merely understanding and trying hard to follow the example of Jesus often yield little progress--and even less joy and peace? In this foundational work of Christian formation, Klaus Issler derives insights from the life of Jesus in the Gospels to uncover the dynamics of becoming Christlike. You will discover how you can forge much deeper connections with Jesus so that his life begins to permeate your own character.</p><p><strong>Klaus Issler</strong> (Ph.D., Michigan State) is professor of Christian education and theology in the doctoral program in educational studies at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California. He is the author of <em>Wasting Time with God.</em><br><br>Calvin Miller (1936-2012) was a professor at Beeson Divinity School. The beloved author of more than forty books, Miller was also well known as a poet, artist, novelist and speaker. His later works included <em>Preaching</em> (Baker), <em>O Shepherd Where Art Thou?</em> (Broadman Holman) and <em>Conversations with Jesus</em> (Harvest House). He summed up his rule of life in four words: "Time is a gift.""Klaus Issler's multifaceted approach to spiritual formation will be a reliable guide. . . . <em>Living into the Life of Jesus</em> bridges the delicate balance between rigorous scholarship and practical steps for application and life change." (Christy Hill, Christian Education Journal, Spring 2013)<br><br>"In reading this book, it was a delight to again be in Dr. Issler's classroom under his tutelage. He inspires me to find fresh ways to live out my life and calling in Christ. He opens his own heart and shares it humbly with me. He is not afraid to challenge my thinking as well as my heart. I am grateful for his continuing influence on my life through the pages of this book." (Keith A. Kettenring, Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care, Fall 2012)<br><br>"As a pastor I am constantly seeking relevant and insightful books which stimulate not only my own personal growth but also provide an effective tool to help my church members develop the image of Christ in their lives. My criterion for such books is that they be biblically grounded with relevant application. <em>Living into the Life of Jesus</em> is one book that accomplishes that goal for me. Issler offers fresh and deep insights to familiar passages of Scripture. But this is not just an academic exercise. It will challenge your mind and also lead your heart into the practice of spiritual formation that is Christ-centered and empowered by the Spirit of God. This is an essential text for any pastor that seeks to form the character of Christ in his own life and the life of his church." (David J. Mitchell, senior pastor, Calvary Church of Santa Ana)<br><br>"The desire to become more Christlike sometimes gets translated into a list of dos and don'ts which, quite frankly, can be more burdensome than joyful. In contrast, Klaus Issler draws from the teachings of Jesus to provide a fresh perspective on achieving genuine character change. Of particular interest to me is his emphasis on the redemptive potential of marketplace activity and personal wealth. With its generous use of 'prayer projects' and review questions, I believe this book has strong potential for use in classrooms and Bible studies." (Steve Rundle, professor of international business, Biola University, and coauthor of Great Commission Companies)<br><br>"Our life and relationships in Christ simply work right when we live them out from the heart. Issler's scholarship and warmth show us how clearly and deeply Jesus' teachings lead us along that path." (John Townsend, author of the bestselling Boundaries)<br><br>"This book is about learning to live like Jesus: to become more like him, to understand what it means to incorporate his way into our way, to know the heart and mind of Christ. Klaus Issler provides us a fresh and thoughtful perspective of what we can learn and apply from the life of Jesus." (Bill Pollard, chairman and CEO emeritus, The ServiceMaster Company)<br><br>"If you want to be changed by following the way of Jesus, immerse yourself in these penetrating, well-thought-out observations of Jesus' life alongside practical guidance for living into that life yourself." (Jan Johnson, author of Abundant Simplicity and Invitation to the Jesus Life)<br><br>"The more Christian books I read, the more disappointed I become. As well-intended as many of these authors are, too often their final product ends up selling out to the cultural norm of shallow anecdotal responses, overly simplistic solutions, little to no rigorously applied thought processes and mediocre integration of Scripture to their subject matter. Klaus Issler's book is about as opposite of the abovementioned deficiencies as I have read in a very long time. <em>Living into the Life of Jesus </em>was such a pleasure to read; I felt the author and I were having an ongoing discussion versus being preached to in 'black and white.' Throughout the book, Issler shares his struggles, his victories, but most importantly, his personal mistakes. In doing so, Klaus has written a book that I plan on sharing with many of my clients so they may understand, appreciate and be better equipped to meet the challenge of Ephesians 4:13 '[to attain] the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.'" (Raymond P. Gleason, business executives coach, Building Champions)<br><br>"Klaus Issler has identified the key to authentic Christian living: It is a matter of both the heart and discipline. Get ready to drink from a fire hose emanating from the well of truth, the Bible. This book will put you to work and on the road to a deeper relationship with the Lord. The work is worth the investment. Issler combines theology, Scripture, real-life experience and assignments, all designed to sharpen your understanding and Christian walk." (Ken Eldred, businessman/philanthropist, author of The Integrated Life)<br><br>"The formation of good character is the standing human problem, generation to generation, and it is the arena of perpetual human failure throughout history, up to today. The formation of <em>Christian</em> character in companionship with Christ is the verifiable solution to the standing problem and the constant failure. For many decades, Christian sources have not done well with character formation, if they have addressed it at all. Klaus Issler has carefully worked his way through the details of how Christian character formation reliably proceeds. He knows from personal experience and scholarly research how it works. He guides you in the path and enables you to extend what you have gained to others in desperate need around you. <em>Living into the Life of Jesus</em> is a vital resource for any individual or group looking for ways to realize the powerful outcomes of spiritual transformation manifestly presented in the pages of the New Testament."

If this prospect disturbs you, what you are looking for may be freedom from thought.</i></p><p>For a generation now, public debate has been corroded by a shrill, narrow derision of religion in the name of an often vaguely understood &#x201c;science.&#x201d; John Gray&#x2019;s stimulating and enjoyable new book, <i>Seven Types of Atheism</i>, describes the complex, dynamic world of older atheisms, a tradition that is, he writes, in many ways intertwined with and as rich as religion itself.</p><p>Along a spectrum that ranges from the convictions of &#x201c;God-haters&#x201d; like the Marquis de Sade to the mysticism of Arthur Schopenhauer, from Bertrand Russell&#x2019;s search for truth in mathematics to secular political religions like Jacobinism and Nazism, Gray explores the various ways great minds have attempted to understand the questions of salvation, purpose, progress, and evil. The result is a book that sheds an extraordinary light on what it is to be human.</p></p><p><b>John Gray </b>is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>The Silence of Animals</i>,<i> The Immortalization Commission</i>,<i> Black Mass</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Straw Dogs</i>.

Surprising as it may seem for a book on such a weighty subject, <i>Seven Types of Atheism</i> is very entertaining.&#x201d; &#x2015;Tim Crane,<i> The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"A major unmasking defines [Gray's] approach: If one is to be an honest thinker and advance knowledge, one must expose and dismantle the web of popular ideas, convenient labels and lazy thinking that makes up the philosophical orthodoxy . . . Gray has emerged as a unique thinker precisely because he has no time for the pious lies and empty niceties of the academic establishment. He seems to have a sixth sense that helps him detect whatever is shallow, self-flattering and self-deceptive in our notions of ourselves." &#x2015;Costica Bradatan, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"Refreshing . . . What Gray does best in <i>Seven Types of Atheism </i>is not only to draw distinctions among atheists but to make connections between nonbelievers and believers . . . His book offers a way forward.

It&#x2019;s sprightly, erudite . . .

Gray takes deep dives into history, examining the evolution of ideas in a generally accessible way. A valuable examination of one of the many fascinating junctures where religion and philosophy meet." &#x2015;Michael Cart, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A marvellously stimulating account of some major currents of post-Christian thought, in which ideas and arguments leap constantly off the page like white-hot sparks from an anvil.

This chain of eight islands is home to a biodiversity unrivaled anywhere on Earth. In addition, the Channel Islands reveal the complex geology and the natural and human history of this part of the world, from the first human probing of the continent we now call North America to modern-day ranchers, vineyardists, yachtsmen, and backpackers.<br><br> Not far below the largely undisturbed surface of these islands are the traces of a California that flourished before historical time, vestiges of a complex forager culture originating with the first humans to cross the Bering Land Bridge and spread down the Pacific coast. This culture came to an end a mere 450 years ago with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, whose practices effectively depopulated the archipelago. The largely empty islands in turn attracted Anglo-American agriculturalists, including Frederic Caire Chiles&#x2019;s own ancestors, who battled the elements to build empires based on cattle, sheep, wine, and wool. Today adventure tourism is the heart of the islands&#x2019; economy, with the late-twentieth-century formation of Channel Islands National Park, which opened five of the islands to the general public.<br><br> For visitors and armchair travelers alike, this book weaves the strands of natural history, island ecology, and human endeavor to tell the Channel Islands&#x2019; full story.</p><p><b>Frederic Caire Chiles</b> is the author of <i>Justinian Caire and Santa Cruz Island: The Rise and Fall of a California Dynasty</i>.

It was under that moon&#x2014;�slightly smudged by December mist clinging to the streets of Kolkata&#x2014;�that I met a man who told me he was half werewolf. He said this to me as if it were no different from being half Bengali, half Punjabi, half Parsi. Half werewolf under a full moon. Not the most subtle kind of irony, but a necessary one, if I&#x2019;m to value the veracity of my recollections.<br><br>To set the stage, I must tell you where I was.<br><br>Think of a field breathing the cool of nighttime into the soles of your shoes. A large tent in front of you&#x2014;�cloth, canvas, and bamboo&#x2014;�lit from within. Electric lamps surrounding a wooden stage that creaks under the bare feet of bright-�robed minstrels. This tent is where the rural bards of Bengal, the bauls, gather every winter to make music for city people. It&#x2019;s raw music, at times both shrill and hoarse, stained with hashish smoke and the self-�proclaimed madness of their sect. A celebration of what&#x2019;s been lost, under the vigil of orange-�eyed streetlights.<br><br>I am there, that night.<br><br>Outside in the cold, in Shaktigarh Math, a city park. I watch the bauls and their audience through the fabric of the tent. Shadows flit across as they clap and cheer. The crowd extends outside, faces lit by cigarettes and spliffs. Hand-�rolled cigarette between my fingers, grass under my shoes. A stranger walks up and stands beside me. The street dogs are gathering by the field, their eyes hungry. It&#x2019;s one in the morning.<br><br>&#x201c;Afraid to go inside?&#x201d; the stranger asks. &#x201c;They may be mad, but they won&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;s talking about the bauls. I laugh dutifully. I&#x2019;m afraid he wants a smoke, having seen my tin of cigarettes. I don&#x2019;t want to share; I rolled them very carefully. I tell him I prefer the night air to the tent, not thinking to bring up the fact that there&#x2019;s no smoking allowed within. I ask what he&#x2019;s doing outside.<br><br>&#x201c;The music&#x2019;s a little too shrill for my ears. I can appreciate it just fine from here.&#x201d; His voice is gentle, his words unhurried.<br><br>He takes out his own hash joint. I glance sideways at him as he lights up. The flame illuminates a slender face, its glow running along hairless skin and brushing against the lines of shadow that hug his high cheekbones. I&#x2019;m disarmed by his androgynous beauty before he even tells his secret.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a werewolf,&#x201d; he says. Smoke flares out of his mouth in curls that wreathe his long black hair, giving him silver-�blue locks for a passing second. I don&#x2019;t see him throw away the match, but his foot moves to rub it into the soil. He&#x2019;s wearing wicker sandals. Dark flecks of dirt hide under unclipped nails on the ends of his long toes. Apparently the cold doesn&#x2019;t bother him enough for socks or shoes.<br><br>Now, I wish I could tell you this man looks wolfish, that he has a hint of green glinting in his eyes, that his eyebrows meet right above his nose, that his palms have a scattering of hair that tickles my own palms as we shake hands, that his sideburns are thick and shaggy and silvered as the bark of a snow-�dusted birch at gray dawn. But I&#x2019;m not here to make things up.<br><br>&#x201c;Need a light?&#x201d; he asks, and I&#x2019;m startled to find a new flame between his fingers, the hiss of the struck match reaching my ears like an afterthought. Afraid that I&#x2019;ve been caught staring at his dirty toes and beautiful face, I nod, even though there&#x2019;s a lighter in my breast pocket. He touches the flame to my cigarette.<br><br>&#x201c;You heard right,&#x201d; he says, tossing the match. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m actually half werewolf. But you heard right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t ask if I&#x2019;d heard right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were thinking it, though,&#x201d; he says with a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t, actually. I can hear just fine,&#x201d; I assure him. He keeps smiling. I get embarrassed.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for the light,&#x201d; I say with a cough. My lungs burn from too enthusiastic a first drag. &#x201c;I suppose I shouldn&#x2019;t be boasting about my hearing. Wolves have great hearing, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a wolf. And yes, they do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any wolves near Kolkata. Are there? They&#x2019;re probably extinct in India.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just because you don&#x2019;t see them doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;re not there,&#x201d; he says. I observe that his fingernails are as long as his toenails, and as dirty. Little black sickles hiding under them. I nod, light-�headed from the nicotine rush.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen jackals in the golf greens at Tolly Club.&#x201d;<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t say anything. I feel compelled to keep talking.<br><br>&#x201c;My parents have a house. Like a weekend getaway. Outside the city, in Baniban. The caretakers there used to scare me when I was a boy, with stories about wildcats from the woods stealing their chickens. Now that you mention it, there might have been a wolf visit. I never really believed any of those stories. They scared me, though. I never even saw any of those animals. Except a snake, once.&#x201d; A true story. I still remember the gray coils of the serpent lying there by the flowerpots; it had been beaten to death by the help. They said it was venomous, though I certainly couldn&#x2019;t tell.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not afraid of talking to strangers. I like that,&#x201d; he says, swaying slightly now to the rising call of the bauls&#x2019; voices.<br><br>I feel shy now, which is absurd. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your other half, then? Human? Aren&#x2019;t all werewolves half human?&#x201d; I ask him.<br><br>He picks a bit of tobacco out of his teeth, which I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen a smoker actually do. Spittle clicks between his fingertips and his tongue. &#x201c;Family history can be a tedious business. Though family isn&#x2019;t quite the right word.&#x201d;<br><br>And that&#x2019;s all he says. For someone who clearly wants to talk to me, he says very little.<br><br>&#x201c;When did you find out you were a . . . a half werewolf?&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been one all my life. Before we were called werewolves, really.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it like?&#x201d; I ask, the questions flowing from my smoke-�soured mouth. I can&#x2019;t think of anything more awkward at this moment than standing beside this man and not responding to what he&#x2019;s just said to me.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen the movies. I am master of my fortune. The moon is my mistress.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And clich� is your cabaret?&#x201d; I ask. Intoxicated disbelief dulls me into self-�deprecation. I analyze my words, which seem nonsensical. I look around, checking to make sure the others standing around us in the field are still there, to run my eyes over the streaks of their shadows. The rhythm of the music snarls to the throb of light and shadow behind the walls of the tent.<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t growl at me. &#x201c;Are you an English professor, by any chance?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. But close. I am a professor. Of history, actually. Started teaching a couple of years ago.&#x201d;<br><br>His shapely eyebrows rise. &#x201c;History? Tales. The weaving of words. A favorite discipline of mine. I congratulate you on your choice of profession, young though you seem for such an endeavor. To tell stories of the past to children who walk into the future is a task both noble and taxing.&#x201d; I feel a mix of resentment and pleasure from being called young by someone who looks younger than me.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re not exactly children, they&#x2019;re college students&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If only we had better storytellers, perhaps they would learn more willingly from the past,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Am I speaking in clich�s again, Professor?&#x201d;<br><br>A white kitten, its wide eyes rimmed with rheum, looks up at me as it crawls around us. It starts at the violent sound of sticks shattering against each other. I see children mock-�fighting with surprising malice nearby, their screams jarring and bodies lithe against the mist. The kitten stumbles and uses my ankle as cover. The street dogs skirt the edges of the field, pack instinct glittering in their eyes as they surround us. Muzzles peel back in tentative grimaces. Their teeth look yellow under the streetlights. They watch the kitten.<br><br>&#x201c;You like cats?&#x201d; the stranger asks, looking at the kitten, which gingerly licks my fingers with a dry and scratchy tongue as I pick it up. Its little heart putters against my palm. I can feel its warm body shaking.<br><br>Ash flutters from my cigarette as I tap it, brief lives twinkling and fading to gray by our feet. I take care not to burn the kitten.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me guess,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the blood of the wolf within me all along. You&#x2019;ve come to initiate me into the ways of our tribe, to run with my brothers and sisters to the lunar ebb and flow. I&#x2019;m the chosen one. The savior of our people. And the time of our uprising has come. We&#x2019;re going to rule the world,&#x201d; I say, my sarcasm blunted by how serious I sound. I surprise myself with the eagerness with which I tell this story of possibilities to the stranger. The dogs have come closer, ignoring even the threat of so many humans to get closer to the kitten in my hands.<br><br>The stranger grins at me. It&#x2019;s the first time he seems animalistic.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to tell you a story. Let&#x2019;s go inside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t it hurt your ears?&#x201d;<br><br>He takes one deep drag before licking the burnt-�out roach and making it disappear into one of his pockets. I realize that my cigarette has whittled away to the end, its heat tickling my cold fingers.<br><br>The stranger strides toward the tent, through the scattered people smoking, past the food stalls with their cheaply wired fluorescents ticking to the patter of night insects. The sizzle of batter in oil and babble of voices only aggravates the sense that I am treading on the tune the bauls are playing&#x2014;�everything here seems to be part of their music, as if the field itself were one stage, and all of us musicians. I toss the cigarette butt and follow the stranger. The dogs begin to follow as well, but stop. I can see more of them running around the field. Repositioning. I hold the kitten close to my chest and go inside.<br><br>The tent is a different universe. The hot smell of electric lamps tempered by the chill, the sweaty damp of the crowd, the claustrophobic buzz of being inside an enclosed fire hazard. Minstrels&#x2019; feet thump on the stage like drumbeats, twins to the sharper pulse of their dugi drums and tremulous drone of the one-�stringed ektara. Their saffron robes are ribbons of sound, twirling around their bark-�burnt bodies as they dance, their madness set aflame by their own music.<br><br>My ears itch. Their voices are very loud. The stranger doesn&#x2019;t even grimace. Some of the spectators squat on the ground, some sit on folding chairs set in haphazard rows. We sit at the back of the tent. I can feel the cold metal of the chair through my pants.<br><br>The kitten compresses itself into a ball in my lap, its trembling eased somewhat. Its head darts to and fro. The stranger is looking at the bauls, swaying his head, tapping his feet, curling his toes.<br><br>&#x201c;The story?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen. Don&#x2019;t say anything. I&#x2019;m going to tell you a story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I just said&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>He hisses, startling me into silence. The kitten almost leaps out of my lap. I clench my fingers around it, stroking its fur.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; he repeats. He is not looking at me. &#x201c;I am going to tell you a story, and it is true. To set the stage, I must tell you where I was.&#x201d; His words wind their way through the overwhelming sound of the music, which seems to rise with each passing second. The light inside the tent is gauzy. The interior moves in slow arcs as dizziness sets in. I close my eyes. Darkness, touched with blossoms of light beyond my eyelids. His voice, soothing, guiding me as the dark becomes deeper.<br><br>The kitten is purring, vibrating against my hands. I can hear the scrabble of swift paws outside the tent, the anxious snarls of the dogs.<br><br>It is very dark as the stranger tells the story.<br><br>To set the stage, I must tell you where I was, he says.<br><br>It is very dark. I listen.<br><br>Think of a field. A swamp, rather. This is a long time ago. Kolkata. Calcutta, or what will be Calcutta. Maybe it is this very field, this very ground. It is different then, overgrown and marshy, the hum and tickle of insects like a grainy blanket over this winter night. It is cloudy, the moonlight diffuse as it sparkles on the stretches of water hiding under the reeds. The darkness is oppressive. There is no blush of electricity on the horizon, no vast cities for the sky to reflect. Somewhere beyond the dark, there are three villages: Kalikata, Sutanati, Gobindapur. They belong to the British East India Company. They are building a fort known as William. Things are changing, a new century nears. It will be the eighteenth, by the Christian calendar.<br><br>The campfire is an oasis of light. The bauls gather around, flames glistening on their dark swamp-�damp skins, twinkling in their beards. They sing to ward off the encroaching darkness, their words lifting with the wood sparks toward the stars. They sing, unheeding of signatures on paper, of land exchanges and politics, of the white traders and their tensions with the Nawab and the Mughal Empire. Here in the firelight, they make music and tell stories to one another. To the land. To Bengal. To Hindustan, which does not belong to them, nor to the British, nor the Mughals. They know there are things in the wilderness that neither Mughal nor white man has in his documents of ownership. Things to be found in stories. Then again, they also claim to be mad.</p><h2>40 Great Glass Fusing Projects</h2><p>Whether you are new to glass fusing or a veteran glass crafter, you will find fresh ideas in this book.

Set in the period of upheaval in Haiti after the assassination of Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1806, it follows the historical figure of Henri Christophe, a slave who rose to become a general in Toussaint Louverture&#x2019;s army. Christophe declared himself king in 1811 and ruled the northern part of Haiti until 1820. Cesaire employs Shakespearean plotting and revels in the inexhaustible possibilities of language to convey the tragedy of Christophe&#x2019;s transformation from a charismatic leader sensitive to the oppression of his people to an oppressor himself. Paul Breslin and Rachel Ney&#x2019;s nimble, accurate translation includes an introduction and explanatory notes to guide students, scholars, and general readers alike.</p><p>Aim� C�saire (1913&#x2013;2008) was a Martiniquan poet, author, and politician.

Breslin and Ney render the speech of peasants, parliamentarians, and priests in believable English. They have delved into the historical sources of the documents C�saire used in researching the story of Henri Christophe; their introduction situates the play in the history of the French Revolution and in the emergence of independent Haiti.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>A.

But their hopes are ravaged, because the city, no less than the countryside, bears everywhere the mark of the dictatorship's corrosive touch. All the narrator's friends&#x2015;teachers and students of vaguely dissident allegiance&#x2015;betray her, do away with themselves, or both. As they do so, we see the way the totalitarian state comes to inhabit every human realm and how everyone, even the strongest, must either bend to the oppressors or resist them and thereby perish.</p><p>Herta M�ller, herself a survivor of Ceausescu's police state, speaks from intimate experience. Scene by scene, in language at once harsh and poetic, she constructs a devastating picture of a society and a generation ruined by fear. In simple images of hieroglyphic power&#x2015;policeman filling their pockets and mouths with green plums; girls sleeping with abattoir workers for bags of offal; a docile proletariat making things no one wants&#x2015;"tin sheep and wooden watermelons"&#x2015;M�ller anatomizes a country and its citizens and the corruption that has rotted the core of both.</p></p><p>Like the narrator of her novel <i>The Land of Green Plums</i>, Herta Muller grew up a German minority in Ceausescu's Romania, which she eventually left to settle in Germany. Her own experience lends credibility to the voice of her young narrator, who inhabits a deprived police state in which minorities such as the ethnic Germans suffer persecution beyond the quotidian oppressions of Ceausescu's regime. The title refers to the young woman's observations of the swaggering policemen who wolf down plums from the city trees, even while they're still green; the act serves as a symbol of greed, arbitrary power, and stupidity. Although an element of the story is survival, achieved by clinging to the German culture and language, the novel also confronts the older characters' sympathy with the Nazis. Nevertheless, Muller's fictional heroine finds salvation, as she herself did, in modern Germany.<p>Born in Romania in 1953, Herta M�ller lost her job as a teacher and suffered repeated threats after refusing to cooperate with Ceausescu's Secret Police.

Every practice of music, every decision about language, every use of our bodies, every approach to visual media or church buildings forms our desires, shapes our imaginations, habituates our emotional instincts, and reconfigures our identity as Christians in contextually meaningful ways, generating thereby a sense of the triune God and of our place in the world.</p><i>Glimpses of the New Creation</i>&nbsp;argues that&nbsp;the arts form us in worship by bringing us into intentional and intensive participation in the aesthetic aspect of our humanity&#x2014;that is, our physical, emotional, imaginative, and metaphorical capacities. In so doing they invite the people of God to be conformed to Christ and to participate in the praise of Christ and in the praise of creation, which by the Spirit&#x2019;s power raises its peculiar voice to the Father in heaven, for the sake of the world that God so loves.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy S. Begbie is Thomas A. Langford Research Professor of Theology at Duke Divinity School and senior member at Wolfson College, Cambridge. His other books include Resounding Truth: Christian Wisdom in the World of Music.<b>Jeremy Begbie</b><br> &#x2014; Duke Divinity School<br> "David Taylor has established himself as one of the leading voices in theology and the arts today. He brings years of real-world wisdom to his writing, gleaned from hundreds of conversations with artists, worship leaders, and academic theologians from a multitude of different traditions. It is hard to imagine anyone not being enriched by this book. Indeed, you are likely to be given manifold glimpses of the New Creation to come.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Constance M. Cherry</b><br> &#x2014; Indiana Wesleyan University<br> &#x201c;A much-needed book to advance the church&#x2019;s understanding of the formational role of various art forms in Christian worship. He provides a framework for viewing the arts in service to the liturgy without resorting to reductionistic, unilateral conclusions. It is thought-provoking in content and pastoral in approach. His commitment to a context-specific application of the arts makes it relevant to a wide audience. I highly recommend Taylor&#x2019;s book for anyone desiring to expand the arts in worship.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Zac Hicks</b><br> &#x2014; Canon for Liturgy and Worship, Cathedral Church of the Advent, and author of&nbsp;<i>The Worship Pastor</i><br> &#x201c;Reading this book is like finally cresting the highest peak of a mountain range. The horizon is vast and expanding&#x2014;too much to take in! Taylor blows back the boundaries of previous conversations about worship and the arts, and in so doing gives the church sight lines into new (maybe heavenly) territory, visible in the here and now.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Paul Westermeyer</b><br> &#x2014; Luther Seminary<br> &#x201c;David Taylor provides a thoughtful depth of perspective and attendant practical import. Artists and musicians, especially ones who have been treated badly, will find welcome comfort and encouragement for their vocational commitments. Mostly, however, the whole church will benefit.&#x201d;<br><br><b>C. Michael Hawn</b><br> &#x2014; Southern Methodist University<br> &#x201c;A dynamic book. Rather than holding on to impoverished notions or outdated assumptions that constrain what we offer God in our praise, Taylor invites us to imagine how we might worship together if we were immersed in an abundance of artistic creativity as manifestations of God&#x2019;s grace.&#x201d;</p><h2>Amelia Bedelia by the Yard (I Can Read Level 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Learn to read with young Amelia Bedelia!

Their mission: Protect the Iraqi capital and U.S. embassy from a rapidly emerging terrorist threat.&nbsp;<br> <br> A plague of brutality, that would come to be known as <i>ISIS</i>, had created a foothold in northwest Iraq and northeast Syria. It had declared itself a Caliphate&#x2014;an independent nation-state administered by an extreme and cruel form of Islamic law&#x2014;and was spreading like a newly evolved virus. Soon, a massive and devastating U.S. military response had unfolded.<br> <br> Hear the ground truth on the senior military and political interactions that shaped America&#x2019;s war against ISIS, a war unprecedented in both its methodology and its application of modern military technology.

H. Pittard retired from the U.S. Army in 2015 at the rank of Major General after 34 years of active duty service. He was a highly decorated combat leader and commanded units at every echelon from platoon to division, including multiple combat tours in Iraq and the Middle East. In 2014, he was picked to lead the initial U.S. response to halt the aggressive spread of ISIS in Iraq. Dana, a West Point graduate and Harvard fellow, is a vice president with a manufacturing company in Indiana. He currently lives with his wife Lucille in the Indianapolis area.<br> <br>Wes Bryant is a former Special Operations Forces Tactical Air Control Party - Joint Terminal Attack Controller (SOF TACP - JTAC), a member of the elite ground combat forces of the U.S. Air Force who serve as combat airpower specialists for America's special operations units. In 2014, as the senior enlisted JTAC to establish the&nbsp;<i>Baghdad Strike Cell</i>, he coordinated and controlled some of the first airstrikes of America&#x2019;s war on ISIS.&nbsp;Later, he was the senior airpower expert for special operations task forces hunting ISIS throughout Syria and Afghanistan until his retirement in 2018. Wes holds a Bachelor&#x2019;s in Asian Studies and currently pursues writing, editing, and consulting while teaching traditional Kung Fu.&nbsp;He lives with his wife and daughters in North Carolina."In describing a campaign that has been treated so far mostly from the top down and from a broad strategic perspective, Dana Pittard and Wes Bryant have provided us, for the first time, a detailed account of our most recent war against ISIS as they experienced it as assigned insiders from the ground up. They are unabashed in venting their frustration over the constraints imposed by Washington....&nbsp;Most important, however, they effectively capture how the synergistic blend of precision U.S. and coalition air power, courageous and committed Iraqi and Syrian anti-ISIS foot soldiers, and supporting U.S. special operations teams and forward air controllers ultimately crushed the scourge of ISIS on the battlefield without any need to commit large numbers of American ground troops to the fight."<br><br>Benjamin S. Lambeth<br>Nonresident Senior Fellow, Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments<br>Author of&nbsp;<i>The Unseen War: Allied Air Power and the Takedown of Saddam Hussein</i><br><br>"Authors Dana Pittard and Wes Bryant do an outstanding job of illuminating all of the ins and outs of the war against ISIS in their new book&nbsp;<i>Hunting the Caliphate: America's War on ISIS and the Dawn of the Strike Cell</i>. Written from the wartime perspectives of a general officer in Pittard, and a JTAC, Wes Bryant, I thoroughly enjoyed and was enthralled in the way they traded off chapters to give their perspective on the events occurring during a major conflict. Their synopses, timelines and minute details captured me and my attention from the onset. Having deployed to the region a few times during my 25-year USAF career, I can attest to the accuracy of events portrayed in the book and appreciate their time and effort in bringing our war operation against ISIS to light. This book is written for all; however, it is a must read for any veteran who has served, especially those who have served in the past 20 years."<br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Ken Murray (USAF Ret.)<br>Author of&nbsp;<i>On Parr: The Stunning Combat Missions of American Fighter Ace, Colonel Ralph Parr</i><br><br>"With the complementary insights of a general and his senior enlisted man,&nbsp;along with an insider's eye for detail and an unshakeable belief in their mission,&nbsp;Pittard and Bryant expertly pull back the curtain on the front line fight against&nbsp;ISIS. From Iraq to Afghanistan and Syria, Pittard and Bryant describe the development&nbsp;of a devastating air campaign waged from a distance, where rapid life&nbsp;or death decisions must be made with limited information and murky rules of&nbsp;engagement, and where ultimate success hinges on coordination between a stateof-the-art operations center with a small group of highly trained Americans led&nbsp;by Pittard and Bryant, and their indigenous allies battling ISIS on the ground.&nbsp;Eye-opening, candid, and at times deeply human, Hunting the Caliphate is a must&nbsp;read for understanding a new kind of war told by two men who not only fought&nbsp;that war, but helped define it."<br>&nbsp;<br>David Broyles<br>Former USAF Pararescueman (PJ)<br>Co-creator of History Channel's combat drama&nbsp;<i>SIX</i><br><br>"From mass executions to pinpoint air strikes, political and military frustrations&nbsp;and the politics of coalition warfare, Hunting the Caliphate is a compelling blend&nbsp;of military history and first-person memories of the war against terror--the&nbsp;complex battlefield, the joys of victory, the tragedy of loss, and the sacrifice of&nbsp;the men and women who carried out the mission. An insider account from a&nbsp;senior Army ground commander and a front line battlefield airman, the book is&nbsp;a gritty, compelling read for all who hope to understand America's longest war."<br>&nbsp;<br>Deborah Lee James, 23rd Secretary of the Air Force<br>Author of&nbsp;<i>Aim High: Chart Your Course and Find Success</i><br><br>"Simply excellent. Hunting the Caliphate is the first account to give sustained&nbsp;insights into the events and personalities shaping the war on ISIS that academics&nbsp;and journalists have been unable to capture except in snapshots. Effectively&nbsp;written, and with editing nothing short of first-rate, it is a descriptive and gripping&nbsp;narrative from two contrasting yet intersecting perspectives that offers&nbsp;readers a broader view of the US military campaign against ISIS. As a historian&nbsp;of modern combat operations, I applaud the insightful observations appearing&nbsp;throughout that serve to accurately convey an important history--and dispel&nbsp;its myths."<br>&nbsp;<br>Mark J.

Robson gives their traditional meanings &amp; their effects when combined with planets &amp; angles. Convenient tables &amp; a comprehensive index make this volume easy to use. Included are some 110 named stars, as well as 48 ancient constellations &amp; 60 modern ones. Arabic, Chinese &amp; Hindu lunar mansions are also discussed. Since its first publication in 1923, this book has been the classic on fixed stars, the one to which everyone since has referred. About the author: Vivian Erwood Robson, 1890 - 1942, was a librarian by trade. Like many librarians he had a natural bent for research, and, in his particular case, astrology.

She often spends a day or two with teachers and then goes into the classroom for several days to model lessons and writing conferences. "The one-time-only professional inservice is seldom effective," Jennifer believes. "Single-day programs can introduce, inspire, and help bring staff to a common understanding. However, they rarely effect school change. For genuine growth to occur, teachers require time to process and, ideally, modeling. This is why my favorite form of inservice is the residency."</p><p>About teaching students, Jennifer says that her favorite moment is when children discover the thrill of hearing their own unique voice recorded on paper. "From then on, they're empowered -- they see themselves as genuine writers. It's my favorite part of teaching.

Judging from the story of Daedalus and Icarus, humans have been interested in aerodynamics and flying for thousands of years, although flying in a heavier-than-air machine has been possible only in the last hundred years. However, the pilot of today must have a greater technical knowledge and understanding than the pilot of even 15 years ago, with today's multimillion-dollar, highly complex aircraft with many more systems and aerodynamic problems than their predecessors. To operate today's aircraft, a pilot must have more than just a basic knowledge of principles of flight.<br><br><i>Aerodynamics for Aviators</i> is written specifically for pilots, by pilots, and its purpose is to present the basic fundamentals of aerodynamics, communicated at the pilot level.&#x201d; The safety and effectiveness of flying operations depends greatly on the understanding and appreciation of how and why an airplane flies, which makes aerodynamics a critically important subject for pilots. The book's content has been arranged to provide a complete reference for all phases of flying, for both low and high altitude operations, applicable to the problems of flight training, transition training, and general flying operations.<br><br>This textbook is designed to be used with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Part 141 Pilot School Training Course Outline, and will be equally effective for aviation maintenance training, university courses and self-study.

The Theory, as introduced by R.N. Elliott in the early 1930's, defines, quantifies and classifies the seemingly random undulations of mass psychology (market action) into visual patterns.<br><br>Unfortunately, in its original form, many concepts and ideas concerning real-time application of the Elliott Wave Theory were left to the analyst to discover. After over a decade of exhaustive research, real-time trading and teaching, author Glenn Neely has greatly expanded upon and refined the concepts first discovered by R.N. Elliott to help you more accurately apply them to your trading and investments. For the first time, these concepts are presented in a logical, step-by-step fashion in the actual order they should be applied to a chart. Consequently, all guess work typically associated with the Wave Theory has been eliminated for you.<br><br>If you yearn for both a greater understanding of the dynamics of price action and an ability to accurately forecast future price action, this book will help you achieve that goal like no other. It is widely regarded as the most complete explanation of Elliott Wave Theory available...and a feast for both novice and experienced Elliotticians alike.<br></p><p></p><h2>Hope and Healing in Urban Education: How Urban Activists and Teachers are Reclaiming Matters of the Heart</h2><p><p><em>Hope and Healing in Urban Education</em> proposes a new movement of healing justice to repair the damage done by the erosion of hope resulting from structural violence in urban communities. Drawing on ethnographic case studies from around the country, this book chronicles how teacher activists employ healing strategies in stressed schools and community organizations, and work to reverse negative impacts on academic achievement and civic engagement, supporting their students to become powerful civic actors. The book argues that healing a community is a form of political action, and emphasizes the need to place healing and hope at the center of our educational and political strategies. At once a bold, revealing, and nuanced look at troubled urban communities as well as the teacher activists and community members working to reverse the damage done by generations of oppression, <i>Hope and Healing in Urban Education</i> examines how social change can be enacted from within to restore a sense of hope to besieged communities and counteract the effects of poverty, violence, and hopelessness.</p></p><p><p><strong>Shawn Ginwright</strong> is Associate Professor of Education in the Africana Studies Department and Senior Research Associate for the Cesar Chavez Institute for Public Policy at San Francisco State University.</p><p>"In this important new book, Shawn Ginwright reminds his readers that urban youth need far more than high test scores and college readiness if they are to succeed.

Health, Economics And Social Choice (2Nd Expanded Edition)</h2><p>Since the first edition of Who Shall Live? (1974) over 100,000 students, teachers, physicians, and general readers from more than a dozen fields have found this book to be a reader-friendly, authoritative introduction to economic concepts applied to health and medical care. Fuchs provides clear explanations and memorable examples of the importance of the non-medical determinants of health, the dominant role of physicians in health care expenditures, the necessity of choices about health at the individual and societal levels, and many other compelling themes.Now, in a new introduction of some 8,000 words including new tables and figures, Fuchs, often called the &#34;Dean of health economists&#34;, concisely summarizes the major changes of the past 37 years in health, medical care, and health policy. He focuses primarily on the United States but includes remarks about health policy in other countries, and addresses the question of whether national health care systems are becoming more alike. In addition to reviewing changes, the introduction explains why health expenditures grow so rapidly, why health spending in the United States is so much greater than in other countries, and what physicians need in order to practice cost-effective medicine.This second expanded edition also includes recent papers by Fuchs on the economics of aging, the socio-economic correlates of health, the future of health economics, and his policy recommendations for the United States to secure universal coverage, control of costs, and improvement in the quality of care. As was true of the first expanded edition (1998), this book will be welcomed by current students and life-long learners in economics, other social and behavioral sciences, medicine, public health, law, business, public policy, and other fields who want to understand the relation between health, economics, and social choice.</p><p>This is simply the best book there is to introduce students and others to the issues about health services viewed from an economics perspective.

Henry Prize, three-time winner of the Whitbread Award, and five-time nominee for the Booker Prize, William Trevor is one of the most acclaimed authors of our era. Over a career spanning more than half a century, Trevor has crafted exquisitely rendered tales that brilliantly illuminate the human condition. A powerful collection by "the greatest living writer of short stories in the English language" (<i>The New Yorker</i>), <i>Selected Stories</i> brings together forty-eight stories from <i>After Rain, The Hill Bachelors, A Bit on the Side</i>, and <i>Cheating at Canasta</i>.</p></p><p><b>William Trevor&nbsp;</b>was born in Mitchelstown, County Cork, and spent his childhood in provincial Ireland. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin. He&nbsp;is the author of twenty-nine books, including&nbsp;<i>Felicia&#x2019;s Journey</i>, which won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and was made into a motion picture, and&nbsp;<i>The Story of Lucy Gault,</i>&nbsp;which was shortlisted for both the Man Booker Prize and the Whitbread Fiction Prize.&nbsp;In 1996 he was the recipient of the Lannan Award for Fiction. In 2001, he won the Irish Times Literature Prize for fiction. Two of his books were chosen by&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;as best books of the year, and his short stories appeared regularly in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>. In 1997, he was named Honorary Commander of the British Empire.*Starred Review* Trevor&#x2019;s four most recent short story collections&#x2014;After Rain (1996), The Hill Bachelors (2000), A Bit on the Side (2004), and Cheating at Canasta (2007)&#x2014;merge all their pages into this deep reservoir into which avid fiction readers will dip repeatedly. Whether a story found in this magnificent accumulation is new to the reader or familiar, Trevor&#x2019;s technical skills&#x2014;for instance, abrupt time shifts that are seamless and add rich layering to both plot and characterization, and pinpoint-perfect word choice resonant as a subtle but effective spice&#x2014;can be readily recognized by readers with an eye to fiction construction; but on the other hand, these skills will be unconsciously gathered by readers unconcerned with technical analysis. In this master storyteller&#x2019;s hands, rural Ireland becomes the cosmos in which every one of us feels at home. The unfortunate ending of a friendship, the pain of a wife&#x2019;s discovery of her husband&#x2019;s affair, a husband&#x2019;s sacrifice of his affair so his mistress won&#x2019;t be regarded as just someone&#x2019;s &#x201c;bit on the side&#x201d;&#x2014;these specific situations assemble under the book&#x2019;s umbrella theme of ordinary life as undulating waves of pleasures and crises.

In <i>Lovecraft's Monsters</i>, H. P. Lovecraft's most famous creations&#x2014;Cthulhu, Shoggoths, Deep Ones, Elder Things, Yog-Sothoth, and more, appear in all their terrifying glory. Each story is a gripping new take on a classic Lovecraftian creature, and each is accompanied by a spectacular original illustration that captures the monsters' unique visage.<br><br>Contributors include such literary luminaries as Neil Gaiman, Joe R. Lansdale, Caitl�n R. Kiernan, Karl Edward Wagner, Elizabeth Bear, and Nick Mamatas. The monsters are lovingly rendered in spectacular original art by World Fantasy Award&#x2013;winning artist John Coulthart (<i>The Steampunk Bible</i>).<br><br>Legions of Lovecraft fans continue to visit his bizarre landscapes and encounter his unrelenting monsters. Now join them in their journey...if you dare.<br></p><p>Interest in H. P. Lovecraft's fiction never seems to wane. His influence on his contemporaries and on so many writers since he died is a testament to the power of <br> his imagination. Why might this be? Possibly it's the richness of the mythos he created. The monsters, the unseen world behind the screen of normality in our world. <br> My initial exposure to the mythos was during my early teens, when I was reading lots of science fiction, so my experience with Lovecraft strongly contrasted with the sense of wonder and embrace of the unknown in science fiction. H. P. Lovecraft's hidden worlds and the mythos he created seemed inspired by and in turn promoted a sense of &nbsp;fear and dread of the unknown. <br> Over time, I've read numerous pastiches of Lovecraft, but most --for me, at least--are too obvious, and bring little new to the table. I'm far more impressed and often surprised by writers who use the mythos in ways that its creator never dreamed of (and might indeed have him spinning in his grave). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the second time I've edited a Lovecraftian anthology. My first was Lovecraft Unbound, containing mostly new stories inspired by Lovecraft. As readers familiar with my theme anthologies, I always attempt to push thematic boundaries to the breaking point: that is, if I can justify to myself that a story I encounter (by commissioning originals, or by researching and listening to suggestions for reprints) fits within the theme of my book, and I love that story I'll acquire and publish it. <br> For Lovecraft's Monsters, I had three goals in choosing stories: the first, as usual, was to avoid pastiches; the second was to use stories that have not been overly reprinted in the many recent mythos anthologies; third, I wanted to showcase Lovecraftian influenced stories by at least some authors not known for that kind of story. So in this case there are stories by Gemma Files, Steve Rasnic Tem, Karl Edward Wagner, Joe R. Lansdale, Brian Hodge, Nadia Bulkin, and a collaboration by Howard Waldrop and Steven Utley. <br> I believe I've succeeded in all three goals and hope that you enjoy reading Lovecraft's Monsters as much as I did working on it.<b>Ellen Datlow</b> is one of the most successful editors in the genres of fantasy and horror.

Vanhoozer argues that theology is not merely a set of cognitive beliefs, but is also something we <i>do</i> that involves speech and action alike. He uses a theatrical model to explain the ways in which doctrine shapes Christian understanding and forms disciples. The church, Vanhoozer posits, is the preeminent theater where the gospel is "performed," with doctrine directing this performance. Doctrines are not simply truths to be stored, shelved, and stacked, but indications and directions to be followed, practiced, and enacted. In "performing" doctrine, Christians are shaped into active disciples of Jesus Christ. He goes on to examine the state of the church in today's world and explores how disciples can do or perform doctrine. Written in an accessible and engaging style, <i>Faith Speaking Understanding</i> sets forth a compelling vision of what the church is and what it should be doing, and demonstrates the importance of Christian doctrine for this mission.</p><p>Disciples who want to follow Christ in all situations need doctrinal direction as they walk onto the social stage in the great theater of the world. The Christian faith is about acknowledging, and participating in, the great thing God is doing in our world: making all things new in Christ through the Holy Spirit. Doctrine ministers understanding: of God, of the drama of redemption, of the church as a company of faithful players, and of individual actors, all of whom have important roles to play. In an age where things fall apart and centers fail to hold, doctrine centers us in Jesus Christ, in whom all things hold together.</p></p><p><p>Key Selling Points: <br><br></p><li>Follow-up to highly regarded work, The Drama of Doctrine<br><br></li><li>Uses a theatrical model to demonstrate that theology is something that must be practiced, not just a cognitive process<br><br></li><li>Argues for the importance of Christian doctrine for the church's mission<br><br></li><li>Written by a well-respected theologian in the field<br><br></li><b>Kevin J.

I was surprised when my plate arrived and haricot verts turned out to be ordinary green beans.<br><br>His name was Pierce Martin, one of those names that could work backward or forward. The sheets were Tommy Hilfiger.<br><br>I remember because he pressed my face into the pillow&#x2019;s red and blue patriotic design to prevent me from screaming.<br><br>After my birthday dinner, our third date, he begged me to come back to his fraternity house and spend the night in his bed. No sex, he promised. Just kissing. Just holding. The wine made my world spin pleasantly, and he smelled sexy, a hint of musk and a little sweat left from a pickup basketball game. Before I took my first sip of wine, he told me he had scored twenty-five points.<br><br>I said yes to his room.<br><br>I trusted him.<br><br>I&#x2019;d told him I was still a virgin, one of the girls who signed the celibacy pledge at church camp in eighth grade and meant it. He&#x2019;d told me with a solemn face that he wanted his wife to be a virgin. He didn&#x2019;t say anything about himself.<br><br>The first time he asked me out, also the first time he said hello, he slid an arm around my shoulders and walked me across campus as if he already owned the right. Sometimes I picture the moment, my face turned up to his, eager, a puppy, a lamb, a foolish girl. I want to slap her.<br><br>I was decently popular in high school but not material for the Pierce Martins of the world. So when Pierce--funny, smart, rich frat-boy Pierce--picked me out of at least fifty other girls in my college economics class, intoxication seeped its way into every insecure crack. He wasn&#x2019;t looking for the test answers for next Tuesday from the girl who scored 103 on the last quiz. He wanted the other me.<br><br>As soon as I stepped inside his room that night, it began to feel weird. The lights were off. Pierce&#x2019;s roommate lay sleeping across the top bunk, a long, dark lump, his face to the wall. Pierce had introduced him to me once, briefly, in the cafeteria. He was a legacy forced on the fraternity, a skinny freshman with random red splotches on his face from squeezing pimples, which he clearly despaired about when alone with the bathroom mirror. Pierce chose him for a little brother so he could abuse him the rest of the semester as a personal slave. He washed Pierce&#x2019;s dirty underwear, fetched Pierce&#x2019;s takeout, lied to Pierce&#x2019;s mother on the phone.<br><br>It seemed funny, before the rape. How easily I lost my center.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x201d; Pierce assured me. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t care. He&#x2019;s a deep sleeper. Like in a tomb. Nothing wakes him.&#x201d; I crawled hastily into the bottom bunk, suddenly wishing I hadn&#x2019;t chosen a skirt over the pants I slid off at the last minute. I&#x2019;d stay half an hour, tops, I decided, then say good night.<br><br>Lying flat in that dark cave, staring up at the bedsprings, I didn&#x2019;t realize Pierce had stripped to a T-shirt and boxers until he pushed his body against mine and swirled his warm tongue in my ear. Still, I thought: This will be OK. Kissing. Maybe even a little more.<br><br>I sank into him. I was butter melting along the path of nomadic, expert hands. His tongue roved lower, a friendly snake. I didn&#x2019;t want it to stop.<br><br>Minutes later, he slipped cool fingers up my skirt and yanked my underwear down. His nails raked the side of my leg, leaving a red scratch I&#x2019;d find the next day.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>I said it as urgently as I could, leg stinging, my brain flipped back on like he&#x2019;d thrown a switch. My voice was soft, not wanting to wake his roommate. Not wanting to humiliate any of us. I was still hopeful.<br><br>Those were my last words to Pierce Martin.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a tease.&#x201d; He clapped his hand over my mouth and flipped me over. He&#x2019;s done this before, I thought, struggling a little, still sure I&#x2019;d get away, still trying not to wake his roommate, still wanting to limit my embarrassment. The roommate had an unfortunate name straight out of a historical romance. Pierce made fun of it. Wheaton. No, Haywood. That was it. Haywood Worthington.<br><br>Pierce gripped my hair and yanked my head backward, pain ripping through my skull. His lips brushed my ear like a lover&#x2019;s. The whisper floated into my ear, down the dark tunnel to my brain, settling inside me.<br><br>&#x201c;Lie still,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The night with Pierce wasn&#x2019;t a fork in the road of my life because I didn&#x2019;t get to pick which way to go. More like a screeching U-turn.<br><br>I&#x2019;m thirty-two years old. Up to this point, I&#x2019;ve told only five people about that night: the campus police officer on duty at 3 a.m., a bored woman who put down her pen and said I&#x2019;d never be able to prove it; Rosemary Jansen, my roommate that semester, whom I don&#x2019;t even exchange Christmas cards with; and my parents, who are no longer alive.<br><br>I still consider the rape a secret, but we all know there are really no secrets.<br><br>All of us walk around with ridiculous amounts of intimate information about strangers and acquaintances. We&#x2019;d never get out of bed if we realized how much peripheral people in our lives know about us. What even the people we love most say behind our backs. The number of confidences broken.<br><br>A co-worker, a person named Anne whom I barely know, is the sister of a woman married to one of New York&#x2019;s senators. Anne told me once over a happy hour that her sister keeps a private apartment in San Francisco for her lover. The senator, her husband, doesn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>Just a stray fact, a shard of conversation that disappeared from her mind into the next tequila shot.<br><br>The senator is a regular on primetime news shows, and now every time I see him interviewed, I think, You&#x2019;re famous. I&#x2019;ve never met you. I&#x2019;ve never met your wife. Our lives haven&#x2019;t touched. But I know this thing that could blow up your world.<br><br>I wonder about the people on the periphery of my secret. My parents probably told Father Joe about the rape as they sought counsel from our family priest to help me. I&#x2019;m sure Pierce bragged about that night to his fraternity brothers, who told their girlfriends, who in turn will use my story someday as a cautionary tale for their daughters.<br><br>I imagine my old roommate Rosemary bringing me up as a personal example of being touched by rape. That happened to my college roommate, she might say at a party of fellow suburbanites. I tried to get her to turn him in, call the frat board, anything, but she wouldn&#x2019;t. She thought it was her fault.<br><br>It was my fault. I don&#x2019;t care what a court of law says about the word no or my polite &#x201c;please don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I laid myself down in that bed. I was naive, stupid, shallow, flashing my virginity around like it somehow made me better. A prize somebody could win.<br><br>Haywood might still be keeping my secret because it was his, too. That night, Pierce branded us both with humiliation and guilt, the kind that embeds in your skin like a tick and spreads disease.<br><br>When my mind travels back there, the shame flares up from the embers, licking at my soul until I find myself flushed and kneeling over the toilet. So I&#x2019;ve worked at not thinking about it.<br><br>Until Clairmont, Texas. This small dot on the map, thousands of miles away from where my story began, is the place that my past and present exploded.<br><br>My mother believed that Fate is a compass inside us. If she hadn&#x2019;t met my father in college, she said, she would have found him somewhere else along the way. We choose our steps, she insisted, but they always take us to the place we&#x2019;re meant to go.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know how she could reconcile such loosey-goosey mysticism with her belief in Catholicism, especially if she&#x2019;d known how she and Dad were going to die.<br><br>If you follow her theory, we are responsible for running dead-on into the evil as well as the good.<br><br>Misty and Caroline turned out to be both. Good and evil.<br><br>My kindred spirits and my tormentors.<br><br>They were the catalysts to free my soul.<br><br>But their secrets almost killed me.<br>2<br><br>If someone asked a few months ago, I&#x2019;d say my compass pointed north. But a strange wind blew me here, and I held my breath.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want much. Just for every moment to be like this one. Blessedly normal. For the shadows to go poof, little vampires extinguished by the sun.<br><br>There was plenty of sun. Mike lay in a yellow patch of it, stretched out on the bed, nursing a bottle of Sam Adams, surrounded by piles of my discarded clothes. He flipped the pages of a Sports Illustrated while absently observing my state of fashion crisis.<br><br>I&#x2019;d ripped open every U-Haul moving box that littered the floor of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Eyes up here,&#x201d; I ordered. &#x201c;What do you think of this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it looks good. Just like the last five things you&#x2019;ve tried on.&#x201d; He patted the bed. &#x201c;Why are you worrying about this so much? It&#x2019;s not like you&#x2019;re walking into a room full of celebrities. And, I&#x2019;d like to point out, you&#x2019;ve actually done that with a lot less drama beforehand.&#x201d;<br><br>I propped the full-length mirror leaning against the wall in a better position to see the side effects of a protruding belly.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d want me to wow them, chief,&#x201d; I said, tugging the orange top down so it wouldn&#x2019;t show the safety pin keeping my pants together. &#x201c;This makes me look like a construction cone.&#x201d; I yanked the top over my head and slung it at his head.<br><br>I&#x2019;d started to really show in the last couple of months, but the move and goodbye lunches with colleagues and friends left no time for maternity shopping. In the life I&#x2019;d resigned, as director of a small SoHo art gallery, I would throw on something black, a gold cuff, and be done with it. But even in the two short weeks we&#x2019;d been in Texas, I could see that would make me look like a fat crow among a flock of colorful, glittery birds.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to stand out as too . . . New York. My father always said, &#x2018;Make a bad first impression and you&#x2019;re digging yourself out of a grave for years, make a good first impression and people--&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;--will give you the benefit of the doubt forever.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m familiar with the wisdom. And why do you think New York is an instant bad impression?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re snotty, rude, walk too fast, use big words when little ones will do just fine. Steal their best baseball players.&#x201d;<br><br>Mike moved from the bed to the floor, kneeling with his ear pressed against my bare tummy. &#x201c;Just be your quirky, sweet self,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Texas thanks God and the Yankees every day for stealing their overpriced baseball players. I hear they&#x2019;ve incorporated it into the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer.&#x201d;<br><br>My hand rested gently on his head, shaved bare to avoid the inevitable, the unexpected bonus being that it made him look even fiercer during his seven-year run as an ATF agent. Mike had led a brotherhood of men who carried recessive genes from cavemen ancestors to kill and protect the way others carry genes for cancer and beauty. I&#x2019;d watched these men drink beer and tease one another in my kitchen like regular guys, but they never, ever truly relaxed. I sleep beside one of them, so I know. They are different from the rest of us.<br><br>Our mirror reflected a happy, loving union. No fear, no tension, no anger. No hint of three years of painful infertility treatments, miscarriages, weeks of utilitarian sex, and hot words that nearly ripped us in two.<br><br>My eyes remained glued to the couple reflected there, hoping it was real. In Mike&#x2019;s case, the bald look worked, like it did on men without ridged Cro-Magnon skulls, making him even more attractive than he was before.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, give me a more detailed rundown on my hostess tonight.&#x201d; It was my practice to be fully equipped before negotiating a room of strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;Three words,&#x201d; I demanded. An old game we played.<br><br>Mike shrugged. &#x201c;Rich. Widow. Tragic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK, need more than that. And your left hand needs to stop right there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think she lost a son,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if she cast a vote, but she attended my final interview, so she wields power here in little Clairmont. Mostly with her wallet. I was told she provided seed money for some upgrades at the new head-quarters.&#x201d;<br><br>So far, my only impression of Caroline Warwick was a soft Southern drawl on the other end of the phone. Three days ago, she invited me to a gathering of the town&#x2019;s female elite and seemed slightly annoyed when I told her I&#x2019;d have to get back to her. Despite his casualness now, Mike had urged me to accept. Get to know people, Emily. Help establish our new life.<br><br>Texas was not even a glimmer in our wineglasses on those late nights after the stick turned blue and we talked dreams with new urgency.<br><br>So Mike was lightly dismissive when an old FBI friend of his mentioned a position leading a well-funded police shop in a high-heeled Southern town, the kind of town rising on Fortune magazine lists. Clairmont, Texas, per capita the wealthiest, most highly taxed city of its size in the country, home to CEOs and Dallas Cowboy football players and Texas land barons and nouveau riche wannabes who carried mountains of mortgage and credit card debt.<br><br>But then there was a phone call from a persuasive headhunter. And another. Mike flew down first-class for two interviews. The salary shone like a gleaming platinum carrot: $175,000 a year, plus a bonus plan tied to lowering the town&#x2019;s crime statistics, which were mostly connected to rowdy teens. In Texas, that amount of money meant something. Mike feared it also meant he&#x2019;d been bought. I could tell it bugged him, this worry that he, the caped crusader, was selling out. That maybe he wasn&#x2019;t hearing the whole story.<br><br>When the mayor told him the job came with a brand-new, fully loaded, armored Hummer, Mike thought he was joking. He asked if most Clairmonters carried grenades and ran from crime scenes on foot, in which case the Hummer would be fine. When nobody in the room laughed, he said he preferred a basic high-speed cruiser.</p><h2>"Those Who Labor for My Happiness": Slavery at Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Monticello (Jeffersonian America)</h2><p><p></p><p>Our perception of life at Monticello has changed dramatically over the past quarter century. The image of an estate presided over by a benevolent Thomas Jefferson has given way to a more complex view of Monticello as a working plantation, the success of which was made possible by the work of slaves. At the center of this transition has been the work of Lucia "Cinder" Stanton, recognized as the leading interpreter of Jefferson&#x2019;s life as a planter and master and of the lives of his slaves and their descendants. This volume represents the first attempt to pull together Stanton&#x2019;s most important writings on slavery at Monticello and beyond.</p><p>Stanton&#x2019;s pioneering work deepened our understanding of Jefferson without demonizing him. But perhaps even more important is the light her writings have shed on the lives of the slaves at Monticello. Her detailed reconstruction for modern readers of slaves&#x2019; lives vividly reveals their active roles in the creation of Monticello and a dynamic community previously unimagined. The essays collected here address a rich variety of topics, from family histories (including the Hemingses) to the temporary slave community at Jefferson&#x2019;s White House to stories of former slaves&#x2019; lives after Monticello. Each piece is characterized by Stanton&#x2019;s deep knowledge of her subject and by her determination to do justice to both Jefferson and his slaves.</p><p>Published in association with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Lucia Stanton is Shannon Senior Historian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello.</p><p>I have great admiration for these varied pieces, and the title essay is simply magisterial. I doubt it will ever be bettered. It is a remarkably empathetic piece, recovering the inner world of slaves and their myriad connections to their owner.</p> (Philip D.

For more than sixty years, opinion has been bitterly divided on what they achieved. Did Yalta pave the way to the Cold War? Did FDR give too much to Stalin? In this groundbreaking book, Harvard historian S. M. Plokhy draws on newly declassified Soviet documents and unpublished diaries and letters of the participants to set the record straight.<br><br></p><p>Serhii Plokhii (Plokhy) is Mykhailo Hrushevsky professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University and the author of several award-winning books on Ukrainian and Russian history, including The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine (Oxford, 2001), The Origins of the Slavic Nations: Premodern Identities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (Cambridge, 2006), and Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past (Toronto, 2008). His revisionist account of the 1945 Yalta conference, Yalta: The Price of Peace was released by Viking Press on 4 February 2010, to mark the 65-th anniversary of the start of the Yalta Conference.Starred Review. Harvard historian Plokhy (<i>Unmaking Imperial Russia</i>) enhances his stature as a scholar of modern Russia in this convincing revisionist analysis of the February 1945 Yalta conference. Plokhy makes sophisticated use of Soviet sources to make a case that Yalta was anything but the diplomatic defeat for the West so often depicted in cold war literature. He describes Yalta in the context of a clash between different approaches to international relations. FDR was a liberal internationalist. Churchill and Stalin saw the world in terms of power and interests. And with the Red Army only 50 miles from Berlin, Stalin held the trump cards. Plokhy's detailed and highly engrossing narrative of the negotiations shows that the West did reasonably well. Roosevelt's agenda was global. He secured Stalin's commitment to join the war against Japan and participate in the U.N. Churchill, focused on Europe, preserved British interests in the Mediterranean. Stalin achieved recognition of the U.S.S.R.'s great-power status and a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. The Yalta agreement was not the first conflict of the cold war but just a step toward a cold war that emerged only after three more years of failed negotiations.

His working-class Scottish family arrived at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Carnegie worked hard, in factories and telegraphy. He invested in railroads, eventually becoming the richest man in the world during his time. <br> <br> Carnegie believed strongly in sharing his wealth, and one of the ways he did this was by funding the construction of over 2,500 public libraries around the world. His philanthropy completely revolutionized public libraries, which weren&#x2019;t widespread at the time. <br><br>Told in simple, lyrical text, the story unfolds against striking, stylized illustrations that transport readers to the bustle and boom of the Industrial Revolution.

Helping to support his family, Carnegie worked in a cotton mill. Later he became a messenger boy and then a telegraph operator with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Always a hard worker, Carnegie saved and invested his earnings. By age 35 he was a very rich man. Selling his steel mills to J.P. Morgan, Carnegie was able to fulfill his lifelong desire to give away half a billion dollars. Much of the money went to the building of libraries across the United States and around the globe. This title focuses on Carnegie's love of learning and libraries. The text is lyrical, but the highlight of the volume is Maurey's stylized drawings, which depict Carnegie in the various stages of his life. Additional information at the end of the book touches on Carnegie's dislike of labor unions, but otherwise the narrative is upbeat.

Elegant, noble, and spiritual, the sandhill crane is one of the most ancient of all birds. More than a half-million strong, flying in squadrons, these majestic creatures point northward to their Arctic and sub-Arctic breeding ranges. Theirs is an epic story of endurance through the ages.&nbsp;With 153 stunning&nbsp;color photographs, <i>On Ancient Wings</i> presents sandhill cranes in their wild but increasingly compromised habitats today. Over the course of five years, Michael Forsberg documented the tall gray birds in habitats ranging from the Alaskan tundra, to the arid High Plains, from Cuban nature preserves to suburban backyards. With an eye for beauty and an uncommon persistence, the author documents the cranes&#x2019; challenges to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing natural world. Forsberg argues that humankind, for its own sake, should secure the cranes&#x2019; place in the future. <i>On Ancient Wings</i> intertwines the lives of cranes, people, and their common places to tell an ancient story at a time when sandhill cranes and their wetland and grassland habitats face daunting prospects.</p><p>Michael Forsberg is a professional photographer whose work has been published worldwide and has won awards in the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Pictures of the Year competitions.

Here, Michaelangelo Matos tells the story of how it emerged from an extraordinary period of creativity to become one of the landmark recordings of the 1980s. He also illustrates beautifully how - if a record is great enough and lucky enough to hit you at the right time - it can change your way of looking at the world.</p><p>The most immediately striking thing about Sign 'O' the Times is the jazzy sensibility running through it. Prince's father was a jazz musician, his mother a vocalist; he'd been a fan of chops-heavy jazz-fusion as well as rock and R&amp;B growing up. But when Prince began recording for Warner Bros., he abjured the brass sections that dominated groups like Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Parliament-Funkadelic, opting instead for stacked synthesizer patterns and a spare, cold feel that markedly contrasted with lush, overarranged disco and the wild, thick underbrush of the era's giant funk ensembles; Rickey Vincent, author of Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One, dubbed it "naked funk." Getting away from traditional R&amp;B instrumentation is an underappreciated aspect of Prince's crossover success; Prince is also said to have actively disliked the sound of horns early in his career.<p>MICHAELANGELO MATOS was born and raised in Minneapolis. A former staff writer at Seattle Weekly, he has written extensively for Minneapolis/St. Paul's City Pages, Village Voice, Spin, Nerve.com, Time Out New York, Urb, Stereo-Type, Chicago Reader, Baltimore City Paper, and Creative Loafing Atlanta.

Famed archaeologist John Romer draws on a lifetime of research to tell one history's greatest stories; how, over more than a thousand years, a society of farmers created a rich, vivid world where one of the most astounding of all human-made landmarks, the Great Pyramid, was built. Immersing the reader in the Egypt of the past, Romer examines and challenges the long-held theories about what archaeological finds mean and what stories they tell about how the Egyptians lived. More than just an account of one of the most fascinating periods of history, this engrossing book asks readers to take a step back and question what they've learned about Egypt in the past. Fans of Stacy Schiff's <i>Cleopatra</i> and history buffs will be captivated by this re-telling of Egyptian history, written by one of the top Egyptologists in the world.</p><p>JOHN ROMER has worked in Egypt since 1966 on archaeological digs in many key sites, including the Valley of the King and Karnak.

Ibn Arabi (1165-1240) knew and influenced the great men of his time, including Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Jalaluddin Rumi and Suhrawardi, and his influence spread beyond the Islamic world to medieval Europe. Dante shows the influence of Ibn Arabi in the Divine Comedy for example.The book has four sections. First is the interpreter&#39;s introduction which includes a biography of Ibn Arabi and a discussion of his approach to Sufism. The second concerns Ibn Arabi&#39;s devotion to the Prophet Muhammad as the perfect man and gives a description of his character and actions. Third is a listing of the 201 names and attributes of the Prophet. The fourth is an interpretation of The Tree of Being a commentary on the mystical elements of the Qur&#39;an and Islam comprising an inspired description of the cosmos and the perfect man as microcosm.</p><p>(translator) <b>Tosun Bayrak</b>, born in Istanbul, has devoted the last forty years of his life to Sufism and is the Shaykh of the Jerrahi-Halveti Order in the USA.In addition to two books of poetry in Turkish and many articles on art and religion in both the USA and Turkey, he has published many books on Sufism.</p><h2>Mrs. Spring Fragrance: A Collection of Chinese-American Short Stories (Dover Books on Literature &amp; Drama)</h2><p>These remarkable tales rank among the first works of fiction published by a Chinese-American author. The daughter of an English shipping merchant and his Chinese wife, Edith Maude Eaton grew up in Canada and settled in the United States. She pursued a career in journalism under the pen name Sui Sin Far. A mixed-heritage woman in a culture rife with anti-Chinese sentiment, she was a pioneer in expressing the struggles and triumphs of the immigrant experience. <br>In these deceptively simple fables of family life, Sui Sin Far offers revealing views of life in Seattle and San Francisco at the turn of the twentieth century. Her observations of the tensions of cultural assimilation reflect the difficulties of maintaining old customs in a new environment as well as the challenges that accompany new freedoms. This collection features the title story, in which a young Chinese woman acts as a bridge between immigrant parents and their Americanized children; "In the Land of the Free," an ironically titled account of suffering inflicted by discriminatory immigration laws; "The Story of One White Woman Who Married a Chinese"; "The Three Souls of Ah So Nan"; "The Sing Song Woman"; and other captivating tales.</p><p></p><h2>363 Days of Tea</h2><p>363 Days of Tea is a coffee table book by Ruby Silvious.

His hilarious chronicle of the year he spent working for Carnival Cruise Lines takes readers down into the areas where the crew works and lives, leaving readers gasping with laughter as they&#x2019;re assaulted nonstop with events that range from the absurd to the utterly bizarre. Stewards fighting over food. Cutlery allowances and other nonsensical rules. What the crew calls those onboard (no, it&#x2019;s not passengers&#x201d;). And of course, the sex. An abundance of ready, willing, and able bodies eager for action on a vessel replete with nooks and crannies leads to love in some mighty strange, and seemingly impossible, places. Breezy, entertaining, and informative, <i>Cruise Confidential</i> is essential reading for those planning a cruise or for anyone who just needs a good laugh.</p><p>Brian David Bruns lives in Nevada, USA.Bruns, founder of a successful software company, decided to follow his new girlfriend, who worked on a luxury cruise liner, and enjoy a high-seas adventure. His plan, to get hired on as a member of the crew, seemed simple enough, but Bruns quickly discovered he had no idea what he was getting himself into. This is a very funny, behind-the-scenes exploration of a cruise ship. Imagine a combination of Innocents Abroad and The Love Boat, with a dash of Peyton Place, and you&#x2019;ll have a good idea of what&nbsp;to expect: lots of humorous fumbling about as men and women of various nationalities mold themselves into an efficient team without stepping on each others&#x2019; cultural toes; the glitz and polished shine of a seagoing luxury hotel (contrasted with the sometimes-disgusting living conditions of the crew); and plenty of shenanigans, including raucous parties and, of course, sexual escapades. Although this isn&#x2019;t an expos� of cruise lines so much as a lighthearted adventure, readers planning a cruise will glean lots of useful information, and cruise veterans may find themselves looking at their familiar turf in a new, slightly suspicious way. --David Pitt</p><h2>Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914 (General Military)</h2><p><p>The fighting that raged in the East during the First World War was every bit as fierce as that on the Western Front, but the titanic clashes between three towering empires--Russia, Austro-Hungary, and Germany--remains a comparatively unknown facet of the Great War. </p><p> With the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of the war in 2014, <i>Collision of Empires</i> is a timely expos� of the bitter fighting on this forgotten front--a clash that would ultimately change the face of Europe forever.

He lives in Atlanta with his wife and sons.Darktown <br> <br>1<br> <br>IT WAS NEARING midnight when one of the new lampposts on Auburn Avenue achieved the unfortunate fate of being the first to be hit by a car. Shards of a white Buick&#x2019;s headlight fell scattered across the sidewalk below the now-leaning pole.<br> <br>Locusts continued their thrum in the thick July air. Windows were open throughout town, the impact no doubt waking many. The lone pedestrian on that block, an old man on his way home from sweeping floors at a sugar factory, was no more than ten yards away. He had stepped back when the car jumped the curb but now he stopped and watched for a moment, in case the pole should come crashing the rest of the way down. It didn&#x2019;t. At least not yet.<br> <br>The Buick reversed, slowly, the front wheel easing off the curb. The movement caused the pole to lean the other way, too far, and then back again, a giant metronome.<br> <br>The pedestrian could hear a woman&#x2019;s voice, shouting. Something about what on earth do you think you&#x2019;re doing, just take me home, that sort of thing. The pedestrian shook his head and shambled off before something worse might happen.<br> <br>Whether or not the lampposts were new, exactly, was a matter of perspective. It had been a few months now, but considering how many years it had taken the leaders of Atlanta&#x2019;s colored community to convince the mayor to install them, and considering the many, many years in which Negroes had walked down even their busiest and most monied street in darkness, the celestial presence of those lampposts still felt new.<br> <br>None of which was known to the Buick&#x2019;s driver.<br> <br>He had been attempting to turn around in the middle of the otherwise empty street but had misjudged his turning radius, or the width of the road, or general physics. He also perhaps hadn&#x2019;t noticed that two blocks away were two Atlanta police officers.<br> <br><br> <br>Five minutes earlier, Officer Lucius Boggs finally confronted his partner, Tommy Smith, about his limp.<br> <br>&#x201c;You did not hurt yourself playing baseball. Own up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a hard slide,&#x201d; Smith said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you told McInnis you were rounding third.&#x201d;<br> <br>At roll call, Smith had assured their sergeant, McInnis, that his knee was fine, just a tweak he&#x2019;d felt in a game he&#x2019;d played with some buddies. You know how those sand lots are, sir, no traction. McInnis had listened to this stone-faced, as if experienced enough at hearing colored flimflam but deciding the truth of this matter was not worth prodding into.<br> <br>&#x201c;I fell out a window,&#x201d; Smith now admitted to Boggs. They were standing on Hilliard Street, three blocks from the Negro YMCA whose basement served as their makeshift precinct. At that hour the sun was long gone but it had left more than enough heat to last until it felt like showing up again. Both officers had sweated through their undershirts, and even their uniforms were damp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs folded his arms and couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. &#x201c;And who was the lady you were impressing with your acrobatics?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in the middle of entertaining her with my acrobatics, matter of fact. When her man busted into the apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you crazy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d told me he&#x2019;d left her, pulled up stakes for Detroit. She talked about needing some lawyer to do her divorce papers or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>Atlanta police officers were ordered to abide by a strict moral code&#x2014;no drinking, even at home, and no womanizing&#x2014;but that had not entirely sunk in with Tommy Smith. The Negro officers dutifully avoided alcohol, as they knew all too well that a witness could report them and get them suspended, but for Smith the idea of suddenly becoming a chaste man was altogether too much.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to get yourself killed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do not go after the married ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except for her, and the girl who did that thing with the candied pecans, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s different, she and I went way back.&#x201d;<br> <br>They started walking again.<br> <br>&#x201c;So then what happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think? Pulled on my britches and jumped out the window.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What floor did she live on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Third.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One of them places with no fire escape. I&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;m walking remarkably well, considering.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened with the husband?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did not linger around to eavesdrop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you at least worried?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She struck me as the kind of gal knew how to handle herself and think on her feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs was the son of a minister, and though he had chosen not to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps, the idea of tomcatting across town the way his partner did was utterly foreign to him. His own experience with women had been limited to innocent dates with well-mannered, well-raised young ladies of the Negro intelligentsia, and he was coming off a recent broken engagement to a girl who&#x2019;d finally told him that the stress of knowing her fianc� might be shot or beaten on any given night was too much for her constitution to handle.<br> <br>A squad car approached, the headlights strangely off. Hilliard had neither lampposts nor sidewalks. They stopped talking and stood there, each wondering if they should back up a few steps, or would that look weak.<br> <br>Then the car accelerated, and each of them did indeed take a step back onto the small plot of grass and weeds that served as someone&#x2019;s front yard. The squad car feinted toward them, swerving a bit, then screeched to a stop.<br> <br>They caught glimpses of two white officers whose faces they didn&#x2019;t recognize&#x2014;cops from other beats who just happened to be driving through, apparently.<br> <br>The white cops yelled, &#x201c;Oooh-oooh-oooh!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaah-aaah-aaah!&#x201d;<br> <br>Monkey sounds and orangutan sounds and maybe some gorilla thrown in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Woo-woo-woo-boogga-boogga!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch your asses, niggers!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the squad car sped off, the white cops laughing hysterically.<br> <br>You couldn&#x2019;t show fear. They acted like it was all a harmless prank, even when they gunned their engines at you when you were crossing the street, even when they nearly grazed against you. More than once Boggs had stood in the road to flag down a squad car, needing assistance for an arrest, when the car had accelerated toward him until he&#x2019;d had to leap out of the way. Laughter in its wake. Surely, if the day came when they actually did run over one of the colored officers, they would insist it was an accident.<br> <br>Neither Boggs nor Smith felt like telling stories anymore as they reached the corner of Auburn, the night silent but for the almost mechanical churn of locusts and the call-and-response of crickets. The marquee over Bailey&#x2019;s Royal Theater was off, as were the lights of the jeweler and tailoring shops; someone had left on a third-floor office lamp at Atlanta Life Insurance Company, but other than that and the streetlights, all was dark. Then they heard the crash.<br> <br>They turned, each half-hoping to see that the squad car had hit a fire hydrant or perhaps a brick wall. Instead they saw a white Buick two blocks away, on the curb, and the light pole dancing almost, or at least swaying drunkenly. They watched as the light flickered once, then again, just as each of their homes&#x2019; electricity did during thunderstorms.<br> <br>The Buick backed up. They couldn&#x2019;t read the tags from so far away. Then it started driving toward them.<br> <br>They had been police officers for just under three months now, walking the beats around Auburn Avenue (the neighborhood where both had lived all their lives save the war years) and the West Side, on the other side of downtown. Although Atlanta&#x2019;s eight Negro officers had not yet been entrusted with squad cars, they did have uniforms: black caps with the gold city crest, dark blue shirts on which their shiny badges were pinned, black slacks, and black ties (Smith being one of two cops on the team who went with the bow-tie option, which he found rather dapper). Their thick belts were weighed down by a heavy arsenal of weapons and gear, including firearms, which terrified a number of white people in Atlanta and beyond.<br> <br>Boggs stepped into the road and held out a palm. The white cops may have enjoyed trying to run over their colored colleagues, but civilians were another matter. Or so he hoped. The Buick was driving slower than was normal, as if ashamed. Its headlights glinted off his badge.<br> <br>The Buick stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not turning his engine off,&#x201d; Smith said after a few seconds.<br> <br>Boggs walked over to the driver&#x2019;s door, Smith mirroring him along the sidewalk and stopping at the passenger door. The soles of Smith&#x2019;s shoes hardly made a sound because the cement had been meticulously swept by someone that very morning, not a twig or cigarette butt in sight.<br> <br>The glare from the streetlights had prevented the officers from getting a good look in the car until now. All they had been able to discern were silhouettes of a driver with a hat and a passenger without.<br> <br>Boggs opened his mouth and was about to ask for the driver&#x2019;s license and registration when he saw that the driver was white.<br> <br>That he hadn&#x2019;t expected. What he had suspected, that the driver was drunk, was correct. Boggs was bathed in alcohol fumes as the portly white man gazed at him with something between annoyance and contempt.<br> <br>&#x201c;May I have your license and registration, please, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>White people were not often found in Sweet Auburn, the wealthiest Negro neighborhood in Atlanta&#x2014;possibly in the world, boosters liked to say. Adventurous whites looking for gambling or whores in the darker parts of town would normally troll along Decatur Street, by the railroad tracks, a half mile to the south. Or they&#x2019;d find one of the other, more nefarious areas that the colored officers patrolled. This fellow was either lost or so drunk and stupid that he figured any colored part of town offered the vices he craved, when in fact this neighborhood mostly held churches, real estate firms, banks, insurance companies, funeral parlors, barbershops, and the sorts of restaurants long closed at this hour. A couple of nightclubs did grace the streets, yes, but they were respectable places where respectable Negroes gathered, and they only opened their doors to whites on Saturdays, when Negroes weren&#x2019;t allowed in.<br> <br>The driver&#x2019;s gray homburg was tipped high, as if he&#x2019;d been rubbing sweat from his forehead. Which he needed to be doing more of, because his skin was still shiny. Hair light gray, blue tie loosened, linen jacket wrinkled. He seemed sweatier than a man driving a car should be, Boggs thought. Like he&#x2019;d just been doing something strenuous.<br> <br>On the other side of the car, Smith visually frisked the man&#x2019;s passenger. She wore the kind of yellow sundress that always made him so thrilled when spring came along, and even here in the depths of summer he was not a man to complain about the kind of heat that allowed the women of Atlanta to walk around half naked. She was short enough to cross her legs in the front seat, the hem above her knee. Light glinted off a small locket that looked stuck to the dampness at the small of her throat.<br> <br>She made eye contact with Smith for only the briefest of seconds, just enough for him to gather a few facts. She was light-skinned and young, early twenties at most. The right side of her lip looked a shade of red that didn&#x2019;t match her lipstick. Red and slightly puffy.<br> <br>Although Smith could not yet see the driver, he divined the man&#x2019;s race based on the subtle change in Boggs&#x2019;s voice when asking for the license. Not exactly deferential, but more polite than was otherwise warranted.<br> <br>The driver answered, &#x201c;No, you may not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs was cognizant of the fact that the man&#x2019;s right hand was at his side, on the seat, and therefore out of view. Boggs decided he need not comment on this yet. Hopefully Smith could see it. The man&#x2019;s left hand casually rested on the steering wheel, the engine still running.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hit a light pole, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mighta glanced against it.&#x201d; Not even looking at Boggs.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s leaning over and will need to be fixed, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting my time, boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nothing but a crescendo of katydids for a moment, and only then did the white man deign to look at Boggs. Just to check out how that had registered on this uppity Negro&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Boggs tried not to let it register at all. His face, he knew, was very good at being blank. This had been commented upon by parents, schoolteachers, girlfriends. What are you thinking right now? Where are you? Penny for your thoughts? He&#x2019;d always hated those questions. I&#x2019;m right here. I&#x2019;m thinking thoughts, any thoughts, who knows. And no, you can&#x2019;t buy them.<br> <br>Normally you weren&#x2019;t supposed to look white folks in the eye. But Boggs was the police. This was only the third time he and Smith had dealt with a white perpetrator. Colored officers only patrolled the colored parts of town, where whites were infrequent visitors.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to see your license and registration, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to see anything, boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Boggs felt his heart rate spike and he told himself to stay calm. &#x201c;Please turn your car off, sir,&#x201d; he said, realizing he should have started with that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have the power to arrest me and you know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the other side, Smith took this as the proper time to beam the backseat. He didn&#x2019;t see anything there, other than a road atlas on the floorboards. The car was prewar but in good condition, the vinyl shining. Smith aimed his light at the front seat, where the woman had been staring ahead, her hair blocking his view. He had hoped the light would startle her into looking at him, so he could better study her injury and look for others, but she turned farther away.<br> <br>Smith, unlike Boggs, had a good view of the space between driver and passenger. He saw that the man&#x2019;s right hand was resting protectively atop a large brown envelope.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do have the authority to issue you a traffic citation, sir, and I intend to do that,&#x201d; Boggs said. &#x201c;I also have the ability to call white officers here, should your arrest be required. I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that necessary for something as minor as a traffic violation, but if you want to push things up the ladder with your tone, then I can oblige you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The white man smiled, entertained.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Oh, damn. You&#x2019;re one of the smart ones, huh?&#x201d; He nodded, looking Boggs up and down as though finally laying eyes on a new kind of jungle cat the zoo had imported. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very impressed. Y&#x2019;all certainly have come a long way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, this is the last time that I&#x2019;ll be the one asking you for your license and registration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still smiling at Boggs, still not moving.<br> <br>On the other side of the car, Smith asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, miss?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you talk to her,&#x201d; the white man snapped, turning to the side. All he could have seen from his vantage was Smith&#x2019;s midsection, his badge (yes, we really are cops, sorry for the inconvenience), and perhaps the handle of Smith&#x2019;s holstered gun (yes, it&#x2019;s real).<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you all right, miss?&#x201d; Smith asked the woman. Let&#x2019;s see how the white man likes being ignored. Her face he still couldn&#x2019;t see, though her breaths occasionally made her hair move just enough for him to see the right, bruised side of her lips. Yet she refused to turn.<br> <br>Smith glanced up at his partner over the car roof. Both of them would have loved to see this blowhard arrested, but they weren&#x2019;t sure if Dispatch would bo...</p><h2>Sarah Coventry Jewelry (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>Attractive and versatile, Sarah Coventry(R) jewelry was produced from 1949 through 1984 and is extremely popular with today&#39;s collectors.

Film. Translated from the Russian by Philip Metres and Dimitri Psurtsev. "Tarkovsky now joins the ranks of Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Brodksky. Philip Metres and Dimitri Psurtsev's translations&#x2014;succinct and allusive, stingingly direct and yet sweeping, mournful and celebratory&#x2014;are marvels."&#x2014;PEN/Heim citation<br> <br> "How does one translate the work of Russian classic, Arseny Tarkovsky? Imagine trying to translate Yeats: high style rhetoric, intense emotion, local tonalities of language, complicated historical background, the old equation of poet vs. state, the tone of a tender love lyric, all meshed into one, all exquisite in its execution&#x2014;and all so impossible to render again. And yet, one tries. In the case of Philip Metres and Dimitri Psurtsev, one tries brilliantly, with gusto, with passion, with attentiveness that is akin to that of a prayer, with the ear of real poets. The result? The gravity and directness of Tarkovsky's tone is brought into English without fail, it is here, honest and pained, piercing and even shy at times, like a deer that looks straight at you before it runs. Tarkovsky's ambition was to seek us&#x2014;those who live after him&#x2014;through earth, through time. He does so in this brilliant translation."&#x2014;Ilya Kaminsky<br> <br> "Arseny Tarkovsky was ten years old at the time of the Russian Revolution and died six months before the opening of the Berlin Wall. He spent his career as a poet creating elegant and starkly interior transfigurations of simple happiness and pure grief, triumphs of the individual self against the brutal realities of daily life in wartime and Communist Russia. Through this meticulous translation of his work, readers will encounter a metaphysical complex poetry, at once searing and brooding, very much in dialogue with such great Soviet poets as Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova. Tarkovsky writes of a country where 'we lived, once upon a time, as if in a grave, drank no tea' but still succeeded in making 'bread from weeds,' where the 'blue sky is dim' but nonetheless manages to be the 'wet-nurse of dragonflies and birds.'"&#x2014;Michael Dumanis</p><p>Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky was born in the Ukrainian city of Elisavetgrad (now Kirovohrad) in 1907 and moved to Moscow in 1923, working as a newspaper journalist and publishing his first poems. By the late 1930s, he had become a noted translator of Turkmen, Georgian, Armenian, Arabic, and other Asian poets. During the Second World War, he served as a war correspondent for the Soviet Army publication Battle Alarm from 1942 to 1944, receiving the Order of the Red Star for valor. Tarkovsky's first volume of his own poems, <em>Before the Snow</em>, emerged in 1962, when the poet was 55, and rapidly sold out. His fame widened when his son, the internationally-acclaimed filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, included some of his father's poems in his films. He died in 1989, just before the Soviet Union fell.<br><br>Philip Metres is the author or translator of a number of books and chapbooks including SAND OPERA (Alice James Books, 2015), COMPLEAT CATALOGUE OF COMEDIC NOVELTIES: POETIC TEXTS OF LEV RUBINSTEIN (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2014), <em>A Concordance of Leaves</em> (Diode Press, 2013), <em>abu ghraib arias</em> (Flying Guillotine Press, 2011), TO SEE THE EARTH (Cleveland State University Poetry Center, 2008), and <em>Behind the Lines: War Resistance Poetry on the American Homefront Since 1941</em> (University of Iowa Press, 2007). His work has garnered two NEA fellowships, the Thomas J.

Prize, 2016&nbsp;<br>Shortlisted for PEN Translation Award,&nbsp;2016<br>National Translation Award Longlist,&nbsp;2016<br><br>"These translations seem most intent on capturing Tarkovsky's simple yet hermetic voice in a contemporary American idiom, one that renders his tortured, haunted, and at times quite mystical worldview comprehensible to our auto-tuned, tone-deaf ears, which prefer free verse and colloquial speech rhythms to the rich and various soundscapes instinctive to Russian verse traditions. Metres, speaking of the much-vaunted failures of translation, writes that they "are not failures between languages as much as a property of language itself" (183). Despite the many shortcomings of our vernacular, though, Metres and Psurtev succeed in fashioning rough-and-ready parallels in a spare, enveloping style gray-lit with despair and revelation.&nbsp;The translations rarely if ever seem sententious or heavy-handed, giving each phrase enough breathing room to ramify and implicate. "Between the lines my fate was burned, " Tarkovsky says, "while my soul sloughed off its skin" (123). Religious and orphic longings abound in Tarkovsky's work, and the translators have succeeded not only in producing the tenuous metaphysical quality of the lines themselves but also in stealing something of the fire that's between them.--<b>DIAGRAM</b></p><h2>Ghost Hunter: The Groundbreaking Classic of Paranormal Investigation (Tarcher Supernatural Library)</h2><p>Fifty years before <i><b>The Conjuring,</b> <b>Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters</b>, <b>Insidious</b> </i>and<b> <i>Most Haunted</i></b>, there was <b>Hans Holzer</b>&#x2014;a man known as the <b>&#x201c;Father of the Paranormal.&#x201d;</b> Holzer pioneered ghost-hunting methods still used today, and brought ghosts and ghost hunting into popular culture in the second half of the twentieth century.<br><br><b>Ghost Hunter </b>presented some of the first-ever case studies of haunting investigations, taken from Holzer&#x2019;s own practice in the New York City area&#x2014;ranging from Civil War-era spirits to the tormented ghosts of murder victims.<br><br>For devoted ghost-hunting aficionados curious about the practice&#x2019;s history, there is no better place to start than the first book Hans Holzer wrote, <b>Ghost Hunter</b>.

Mediums and such are the work of the Devil, the cleric sternly advised the owner of the haunted house, and permission for my visit was withdrawn.</p><p>Although the &#x201c;poltergeist&#x201d; case of Seaford, Long Island, had been in all the papers, and even on national television, the idea of a volunteer medium trying to help solve the mystery proved too much for the prejudiced owner of the house.</p><p>Then, there was the minister who carefully assured me that there couldn&#x2019;t be anything to the rumors I&#x2019;d heard about footsteps and noises when there wasn&#x2019;t anyone there. What he meant, of course, was that he <i>preferred</i> it that way. Still, that was one more potential case I lost before even getting to first base. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;these people understand who I am; they have respect for my scientific credentials; and they know their anonymity will be carefully guarded. They know I&#x2019;m not a crackpot or an amateur&#x2014;amusing himself with something he does not understand. In fact, they&#x2019;re very much interested to hear all about these things, provided it happened in <i>someone else&#x2019;s</i> house.</p><p>I am a professional investigator of ghosts, haunted houses, and other &#x201c;spontaneous&#x201d; phenomena, to use the scientific term&#x2014;that is, anything of a supernormal nature, not fully explained by orthodox happenings, and thus falling into the realm of parapsychology or psychic research.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t born a ghost hunter. I grew up to be one, from very early beginnings, though. At the age of three, in my native Vienna, my <i>Kindergarten</i> teacher threatened me with expulsion from the class for telling ghost stories to my wide-eyed classmates. These, however, were the non-evidential kind of stories I had made out of whole cloth. Still, it showed I was hot on the subject, even then!</p><p>Even in Freudian Vienna, ghost-story telling is not considered a gainful profession, so my schooling prepared me for the more orthodox profession of being a writer. I managed to major in history and archeology, knowledge I found extremely helpful in my later research work, for it taught me the methods of painstaking corroboration and gave me a kind of bloodhound approach in the search for facts. The fact that I was born under the truth-seeking sign of Aquarius made all this into a way of life for me.</p><p>I am the Austrian-born son of a &#x201c;returnee&#x201d; from New York; thus I grew up with an early expectation of returning to New York as soon as I was old enough to do so. Meanwhile, I lived like any other child of good family background, alternately sheltered and encouraged to express myself.</p><p>I had barely escaped from <i>Kindergarten</i> when my thoughtful parents enrolled me in a public school one year ahead of my time. It took hundreds of dollars and a special <i>ukase</i> by the Minister of Education to get me in at that early age of five, but it was well worth it to my suffering parents.</p><p>I had hardly warmed the benches of my first-grade class when I started to build radio sets, which in those days were crystal powered. For the moment, at least, ghosts were not in evidence. But the gentle security into which I had lulled my elders was of brief duration. I had hardly turned nine when I started to write poems, dramas (all of four pages)&#x2014;and, you&#x2019;re right&#x2014;ghost stories. Only now they had more terror in them, since I had absorbed a certain amount of mayhem, thanks to the educational motion pictures we were treated to in those days and certain literary sources known as Zane Grey and Karl May.</p><p>My quaint writings earned me the reputation of being &#x201c;special,&#x201d; without giving me any compensation of fame or fortune.</p><p>Gradually, girls began to enter my world. This fact did not shatter my imaginative faculties. It simply helped populate my ghost stories with more alluring female ghosts.</p><p>I was now about thirteen or fourteen, and frequently visited my late Uncle Henry in his native city of Bruenn. My Uncle Henry was as &#x201c;special&#x201d; as was I, except that his career as a businessman had restricted his unusual interests to occasional long talks and experiments. In his antique-filled room in my grandparents&#x2019; house, we held weird rites which we called the &#x201c;raising of the spirits,&#x201d; and which, for all we knew, might have raised a spirit or two. We never waited around long enough to find out, but turned the lights back on when it got too murky. Needless to say, we also indulged in candle rites and readings from my uncle&#x2019;s substantial collection of occult books.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t think my uncle ever believed in the occult, but many years later, just before his passing, he did confess to me that he had no doubts about the reality of &#x201c;the other world&#x201d; and spirit communication. If I am to believe several professional and nonprofessional mediums who have since brought me messages from him, he is now in a position of proving this reality to himself, and to me.</p><p>In 1935 I was fifteen and I had become a collector of antiques and coins and was an ardent bibliophile. One day, while digging through the stacks at a bookseller&#x2019;s, I came across an early, but then rather up-to-date account of the scientific approach to the occult, called <i>Occultism in This Modern Age.</i> It was the work of Dr. T. K. Oesterreich, a professor at the University of T�bingen in Germany. This 1928 book started me off on a serious approach to ghosts.</p><p>At first, it was idle curiosity mixed with a show-me kind of skepticism. I read other books, journals, and learned bulletins. But I didn&#x2019;t attend any seances or have any actual contact with the subject while a teen-ager. My training at this point veered toward the newspaper-writing profession.</p><p>I took a course in practical journalism, and started to sell articles to local papers. The reportorial training added the &#x201c;interview in depth&#x201d; approach to my later investigations. All this time, we had dreamed of coming back to New York, of which my father had fond memories. But it wasn&#x2019;t until 1938, when I had just turned eighteen, that I set foot on American soil. My first job had nothing to do with occultism, and it paid only fifteen dollars weekly in a day when that was just enough to live on uncomfortably.</p><p>Falling back (or forward, if you wish) on my knowledge of antiquities and coins, I became an expert cataloguer and writer for one of the big importers of such things.</p><p>In 1945 I quit my position&#x2014;I was then associate editor of a scientific magazine dealing with coins and antiquities&#x2014;and I became a free-lance writer. My old interest in the occult revived; the flame had never died but had been dormant, and now it burst forth again. More books, more lectures, more seeking out the unorthodox, the tantalizingly unsolved.</p><p>In 1949 I went to Europe as an accredited foreign correspondent, with the intent to write articles on cultural activities, the theater, and human-interest stories. I had begun to write plays and compose music myself, a skill which I have since used professionally in the New York theater. On this trip, which led me from the heel of the boot of Italy to the northern part of Sweden, I realized that much psychic research activity was going on in the countries I visited. However, the brevity of my stay in each place precluded any close contact with these bodies.</p><p>The following year I returned to Europe, again as a foreign correspondent. In this capacity, I covered the theater in London and other major cities of Europe. One evening, I was invited backstage at the Hippodrome Theatre in London, where comedian Michael Bentine was then appearing as one of the stars. Mr. Bentine offered me a home-grown tomato instead of a drink: he immediately ingratiated himself to me since I am a vegetarian. It also developed that Michael and I had birthdays on the same day, though a few years apart. A friendship grew quickly between us, especially when we discovered our common interest in the occult.</p><p>I remember we had a luncheon date in one of London&#x2019;s Spanish restaurants. Luncheon was served at twelve noon, conversation started at one, and at five o&#x2019;clock the owner gently tiptoed over to us and whispered, &#x201c;Dinner is being prepared!&#x201d;</p><p>When I returned home that night, I started to work on a television series based on actual hauntings. Through mutual friends, I was led to a study group composed of earnest young people from various walks of life, who meet regularly in the rooms belonging to the Edgar Cayce Foundation in New York. Their purpose was simply the quest for truth in the vast realm of extrasensory perception. From then on, I devoted more and more time and energies to this field.</p><p>One of the greatest of all living mediums and, at the same time, psychic researchers is Eileen Garrett, who is today president of the Parapsychology Foundation of New York, a world-wide organization that encourages and supports truly scientific investigations and studies in the realm of extrasensory perception. The Foundation also publishes magazines, and has helped the publication of important books on psychic subjects.</p><p>I had met Mrs. Garrett briefly in 1946 without realizing that she was the same person whose psychic reputation had long awed me. The contact with her became stronger after my return from Europe in 1951, when I discussed my work and ideas on psychic research with her from time to time.</p><p>Eileen Garrett had no patience with guesswork or make-believe. She taught me to be cautious and painstaking, so that the results of my research would not be open to question. My friendship with Eileen Garrett helped a great deal. Since she was both a great medium and researcher, I adopted her severe approach. I neither believed nor disbelieved; I looked only for facts, no matter what the implications.</p><p>At the Edgar Cayce Foundation on 16th Street and elsewhere, I also met the handful of nonprofessional mediums who helped me so much in my investigations. My method frequently calls for the presence of a sensitive person to pick up clairvoyantly, or through trance, tangible material about a haunted house, that could then later be examined for veracity. I don&#x2019;t hold with the ghost hunter who spends a night alone in a haunted house, and then has nothing more to show for his bravery than a stiff back.</p><p>To me, the purpose of investigation is twofold; one, to establish the observed facts of the phenomena, and two, to make contact with the alleged ghost. The chances of seeing an apparition, if you&#x2019;re not sensitive yourself, are nil, and I don&#x2019;t like to waste time.</p><p>&#x201c;Ghosts&#x201d; are people, or part of people, anyway, and thus governed by emotional stimuli; they do not perform like trained circus animals, just to please a group of skeptics or sensation seekers. Then too, one should remember that an apparition is really a re-enactment of an earlier emotional experience, and rather a personal matter. A sympathetic visitor would encourage it; a hostile onlooker inhibit it.</p><p>Sometimes an &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; person does manage to see or hear a ghost in an allegedly haunted location, be it a building or open space. Such a person is of course sensitive or mediumistic, without knowing it, and this is less unusual than one might think.</p><p>Even though I am an artistic, and therefore sensitive, person, I do not profess to mediumship, and certainly would not be satisfied with the meager impressions I might gather myself, psychically. A more advanced psychic talent is very necessary to get results. So, I take my &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; with me. If I also see or hear some unearthly things, well and good. That&#x2019;s a bonus. But I don&#x2019;t like unfinished cases. And rarely indeed have I come home empty-handed when I set out in the company of a good medium.</p><p>Are good mediums hard to find? They are! That is why I spend a considerable portion of my efforts in this field in search for good new mediums. These are people with the extrasensory gift, whose interest is scientific, not financial. Natural talents in this field, just as in any other, can be trained. There are strict methods and conditions, and when you work in a field that is still on the fringes of recognized science, the more stringent your conditions are, the better.</p><p>Today, my methods are well thought out. When I hear of a likely case or prospect, I call the owners or tenants of the building, or if an open area, the nearest neighbor or potential witness, and introduce myself. I get as much information as I can on witnesses and type of phenomena observed, then call the witnesses and interview them. Only after this preliminary work has been done do I call in one of my sensitive-collaborators. I tell them only that a case has come up, and when I will need them.</p><p>I discuss everything <i>but the case</i> with them on our way to the location, and when we get there, the hosts have been informed not to volunteer any information, either.</p><p>A good medium like Mrs. Ethel Meyers will immediately get &#x201c;impressions&#x201d; upon arriving, and sometimes even on the way toward our goal. A little later, she will lapse into a trance, and in this condition, the alleged ghost can operate her vocal cords, and speak to me directly.</p><p>Sometimes there is another sitter present, and sometimes not. I take notes or use a tape recorder, or both. And sometimes, too, there is an infrared camera present, just in case.</p><p>After the trance is over, the medium awakens without remembering anything that has just come through her mouth or vocal cords while under the control of an alleged ghost. Sometimes, though not often, the medium recalls all or part of the information thus received because the trance had been light. This does not mean the medium is faking, or that the material obtained is less reliable; it only means that the medium&#x2019;s trance faculties are not in full operating condition, and perhaps hypnosis is in order to get her &#x201c;down deeper&#x201d; into the unconscious condition. Generally speaking, the medium remembers nothing of what went on during her trance state.</p><p>Now I allow the hosts and other sitters to discuss the case freely and comment upon what they have just heard or witnessed. Often enough, corroboration takes place right then and there, but more often I have to dig it up in the public library, special libraries, or other sources to which I have access. The research always takes place after the investigation is closed. The Sensitive is never kept abreast of the progress of the corroboration until the case is ready for publication or filing.</p><p>There is always drama, and sometimes comedy, involved. Ghosts are people, haunted by unhappy memories, and incapable of escaping by themselves from the vicious net of emotional entanglements. It&#x2019;s not a good idea for a ghost hunter to be afraid of <i>anything,</i> because fear attracts undesirables even among the Unseen.</p><p>An authoritative and posit...</p></p><h2>Feed Your Fertility</h2><p><p>Do you want to make a healthy baby and have a healthy pregnancy?</p><p>Are you interested in a holistic approach to fertility?</p><p>Do you need to optimize your fertility due to your age or health conditions?</p><p>Are you trying to conceive and experiencing challenges?</p><p>Very few women and men expect to have trouble when it comes to having a family, and coming up against obstacles can bring about epic levels of stress.

He almost got fired by the owner of a bookstore due to his poor taste in earrings. He worked at a place that showed slides of poopy diapers during lunch (it did cut down on the cafeteria budget). The hazing process at the next company included eating live termites raised by the resident entomologist, so that didn&#39;t last long either.

It was this bond with Pirate, and a fateful night spent desperately trying to save a newborn lamb, that inspired Noel to enter the world of veterinary science - and set him on the path to becoming The Supervet.</p><p>Now, in this long-awaited memoir, Noel recounts this often-surprising journey that sees him leaving behind a farm animal practice in rural Ireland to set up Fitzpatrick Referrals in Surrey, one of the most advanced small animal specialist centres in the world. We meet the animals that paved the way, from calving cows and corralling bullocks to talkative parrots and bionic cats and dogs. </p><p>Noel has listened to the many lessons that the animals in his care have taught him, and especially the times he has shared with his beloved Keira, the scruffy Border Terrier who has been by Noel's side as he's dealt with the unbelievable highs and crushing lows of his extraordinary career. </p><p>As heart-warming and life-affirming as the TV show with which he made his name, <i>Listening to the Animals</i> is a story of love, hope and compassion, and about rejoicing in the bond between humans and animals that makes us the very best we can be.</p></p><p></p><h2>Simply K: A Developmental Approach to Kindergarten</h2><p><p>Too often, our littlest learners are expected to achieve, despite not having reached critical levels of readiness.

He had more meetings than any of his predecessors with the People of God and the leaders of Nations. His love for young people brought him to establish the World Youth Days. He gave an extraordinary impetus to Canonizations and Beatifications, focusing on countless examples of holiness as an incentive for the people of our time. John Paul II, departed this world on April 2, 2005.

He brings a unique perspective and impeccable academic credentials to a narrative history of the British Empire, one that avoids sweeping judgmental condemnation and instead sees the Empire for what it was: a series of local fiefdoms administered in varying degrees of competence or brutality by a cast of characters as outsized and eccentric as anything conjured by Gilbert and Sullivan. <p>The truth, as Kwarteng reveals, is that there was no such thing as a model for imperial administration; instead, appointees were schooled in quirky, independent-minded individuality. As a result the Empire was the product not of a grand idea but of often chaotic individual improvisation. The idosyncracies of viceroys and soldier-diplomats who ran the colonial enterprise continues to impact the world, from Kashmir to Sudan, Baghdad to Hong Kong.</p></p><p>Kwasi Kwarteng was born in London to Ghanaian parents in 1975. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won one of the University Classical Scholarships and graduated with a double first in Classics and History; and at Harvard University, where he spent a year as a Kennedy Scholar. He returned to Cambridge to complete a Ph.D in History, before working as an analyst for a hedge fund in London.

As he struggled to find the right Christian stance toward big social issues such as the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, Mouw discovered Kuyper&#x2019;s Lectures on Calvinism &#x2015; and, with it, a robust vision of active Christian involvement in public life that has guided him ever since.<br><br> In this &#x201c;short and personal introduction&#x201d; Mouw sets forth Kuyper&#x2019;s main ideas on Christian cultural discipleship, including his views on sphere sovereignty, the antithesis, common grace, and more. Mouw looks at ways to update &#x2015; and, in some places, even correct &#x2015; Kuyper&#x2019;s thought as he applies it to such twenty-first-century issues as religious and cultural pluralism, technology, and the challenge of Islam.</p><p>Richard J. Mouw is president and professor of Christian philosophy at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California. His many other books include <em>Uncommon Decency</em>, <em>Praying at Burger King</em>, and <em>Abraham Kuyper: A Short and Personal</em><b>James K. A. Smith</b><br> &#x2014; Calvin College<br> "This marvelous little book pulls off an astounding feat: though it is both compact and accessible, it also gives us the whole Kuyper. Too often we get Kuyper in slices: folks gravitate to a 'side' of Kuyper, adopting his theology of culture but neglecting his emphasis on the church, or picking up common grace but neglecting antithesis. But Mouw, with typical wit and warmth, introduces us to Kuyper in all his multifaceted richness. A gift for the next generation."<br><br><b>John Bowlin</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton Theological Seminary<br> "Part introduction to the principal loci of Kuyper's theology of culture, part personal reflection on the legacy of neo-Calvinism, part Kuyperian&nbsp;<i>aggiornamento</i>&nbsp;for the twenty-first century, Rich Mouw's book is a gem. Its engagement with Kuyper's work is thoughtful and sympathetic, but also questioning and critical, a combination that makes this book a perfect entryway into Kuyper's social thought."<br><br><b>John Stackhouse</b><br> &#x2014; Regent College<br> "Richard Mouw's book does just what it is supposed to do: stimulate our thinking on subjects of consequence, quicken our interest in a mind many of us ought to know better, and improve already great concepts into ideas even better suited to our circumstances. That's a lot to accomplish in a small book &#x2014; of which genre Mouw must now be acknowledged a master."<br><br><b><i>Books &amp; Culture</i></b><br> &#x201c;The genius of Mouw&#x2019;s take on Kuyper is the way he also &#x2018;lures in&#x2019; a Christian reader to a vision so compelling that, once a person sees it, she can&#x2019;t un-see it, and life changes. . . . A splendid book. . . . If readers are not deeply moved by Mouw&#x2019;s conclusion, I declare them here and now to be hard-hearted people! . . . We are much in Rich Mouw&#x2019;s debt, again&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Christian Scholar&#x2019;s Review</i></b><br> &#x201c;Those seeking an overview of Kuyper&#x2019;s thought from someone who has been personally transformed by this theology and who thus believes that Christians should care deeply about the broader culture will be indebted to Mouw&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Journal of Reformed Theology</i></b><br> &#x201c;The importance of this book is that Mouw introduces the Kuyperian tradition to the Evangelical world, and there is no better ambassador for this work than he is. As a real ecumenical writer, he is able to discern the strong points in other Christian traditions and to acknowledge the weaker parts in his own.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Egermeier&#39;s Bible Storybook for Beginner&#39;s</h2><p>Egermeier&#39;s Bible Storybook for Beginners is adapted from the popular classic Egermeier&#39;s Bible Story Book which has sold millions of copies and is beloved by generations of children and adults alike.

Described by Coleridge as `the stillborn twin of King Lear&#39;, the play has nevertheless proved brilliantly effective in performance over the past thirty or forty years.This edition accepts and contributes to the growing scholarly consensus that the play is not Shakespeare&#39;s solo work, but is the result of his collaboration with Thomas Middleton, who wrote about a third of it. The editors offer an account of the process of collaboration and discuss the different ways that each author contributes to the play&#39;s relentless look at the corruption and greed of society. They provide, as well, detailed annotation of the text and explore the wide range of critical and theatrical interpretations that the play has engendered. Tracing both its satirical and tragic strains, their introduction presents a perspective on the play&#39;s meanings that combines careful elucidation of historical context with analysis of its relevance to modern-day society. An extensive and well-illustrated account of the play&#39;s production history generates a rich sense of how the play can speak to different historical moments in specific and rewarding ways.</p><p><p><b>Anthony B.

But we become fully and authentically human precisely by the decisions we make every day&#x2014;some of them relatively simple, others complex and difficult. Once a choice is made, we still must claim the moral resolve and strength of character to implement it. Virtues are precisely the sustained habits that help us maneuver life&#x2019;s many choices and to become the good people that we want to be. St. Thomas Aquinas offers the classic Christian presentation of the four principal virtues of prudence, justice, courage, and temperance. But these are precisely cardinal or &#x201c;hinge&#x201d; virtues that provide the foundational framework for Aquinas&#x2019;s much broader presentation of a multitude of other virtues. Neglect of this larger array of moral attitudes for good living would miss the breadth of Aquinas&#x2019;s insights into a human life truly well-lived. <i>Virtues Abounding</i> explores, in contemporary language, the practical insights that Aquinas offers for the moral life today. Whether in university, seminary, or adult faith formation settings&#x2014;whether for a deeper intellectual understanding of virtues or for personal reflection and growth&#x2014;<i>Virtues Abounding</i> will provide new insight into a classic but too often overlooked storehouse of moral riches.</p><p>Mark O&#39;Keefe, OSB is Professor of Moral Theology at Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology in Indiana.

His inspirations to do this include his own mother, Hilda Stuart, whom he watched document their family's everyday life in Mississippi, bassist Milt Hinton's photographs of fellow jazz artists, and Edward Curtis's well-known images of Native Americans at the turn of the twentieth century. Stuart's work ranges from intimate and often candid behind-the-scenes depictions of legendary musicians, to images that capture the eccentricities of characters from the back roads of America, to dignified portraits of members of the impoverished Lakota tribe in South Dakota, a people he was introduced to through his former father-in-law, Johnny Cash. Whatever the subject, Stuart is able to sensitively tease out something unexpected or hidden beneath the surface through a skillful awareness of timing and composition as well as a unique relationship with many of the subjects based on years of friendship and trust. <p><br><br>This book will present images from these three bodies of work: "Badlands," on his time with the Lakota; "The Masters," from his work with musicians like Bill Monroe, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Dolly Parton, George Jones, Kitty Wells, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings; and "Blue Line Hot Shots." As Stuart explains, "The newly built Interstate Highway System was at one time represented on our maps by the color red, while the two-lane highways and back roads of the nation were represented in blue. The back roads are where you'll find some of the people that I admire, respect, and always keep an eye out for. ... They are renegades ... As Roger Miller once said, 'These people flush to the beat of a different plumber.' " </p><p><br><br>The photographs are framed by an introduction by Stuart and a context-setting essay by photography historian Susan Edwards, executive director of the First Center for the Visual Arts. The book and accompanying exhibition at the First Center demonstrate that Marty Stuart is a master storyteller not only through his songs but also through his revealing and compelling photographs.<br><b>Excerpt</b><br>"When I first began traveling I loved the adventure of going from town to town and exploring what each place had to offer. Whenever possible, on the day of the show I walked the streets and back roads, gathering stories and songs from local folks. I studied everything from the different kinds of architecture that surrounded me to the majesty of the sunsets and how they affected the mood of the town I was in. That first season was filled with the joy of a new musical life taking flight. The applause, the spotlight, the sparkle of the fame, the freedom of 'here today, go somewhere else tomorrow' charmed me night after night, day after day, until show business found its mark and became a way of life. I enjoyed every minute of the dance. I still love those things, but most of all it's the people that I've enjoyed along the way, namely the characters. The kind of characters who can be defined as American originals."<br>--<i>from the Introduction by Marty Stuart</i></p></p><p><b>Kathryn Delmez</b> has been a curator at the Frist Art Museum since 2001.

Wide, gilded mirrors give the impression that the shop is larger than it really is, and the candles flickering from the chandeliers cast a burnished glow across the oil paintings and embroidered settees. It&#x2019;s like entering a comtesse&#x2019;s salon, and this is the effect we have tried for in my uncle&#x2019;s museum. Intimate rooms where the nobility will not feel out of place. Although I could never afford the bonnets on these shelves&#x2014; let alone the silk dresses of robin&#x2019;s-egg blue or apple green&#x2014; I come here to see the new styles so that I can copy them later. After all, that is our exhibition&#x2019;s greatest attraction. Women who are too poor to travel to Versailles can see the royal family in wax, each of them wearing the latest fashions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Madame?&#x201d; I venture, closing the door behind me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rose Bertin turns, and her high- pitched welcome tells me that she expects another woman in ermine. When I emerge from the shadows in wool, her voice drops. &#x201c;Mademoiselle Grosholtz,&#x201d; she says, disappointed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I gave you my answer last month.&#x201d; She crosses her arms over her chest. Everything about Rose Bertin is large. Her hips, her hair, the satin bows that cascade down the sides of her dress.<br><br>&#x201c;Then perhaps you&#x2019;ve changed your mind,&#x201d; I say quickly. &#x201c;I know you have the ear of the queen. They say that there&#x2019;s no one else she trusts more.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re not the only one begging favors of me,&#x201d; she snaps.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re good patrons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Your uncle bought <i>two </i>dresses from me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We would buy more if business was better.&#x201d; <br><br>This isn&#x2019;t a lie. In eighteen days I will be twenty-eight, but there is nothing of value I own in this world except the wax figures that I&#x2019;ve created for my uncle&#x2019;s exhibition. I am an inexpensive niece to maintain. I don&#x2019;t ask for any of the embellishments in <i>Le Journal des Dames, </i>or for pricey chemise gowns trimmed in pearls. But if I had the livres, I would spend them in dressing the figures of our museum. There is no need for me to wear gemstones and lace, but our patrons come to the Salon de Cire to see the finery of kings. If I could, I would gather up every silk fan and furbelow in Rose Bertin&#x2019;s shop, and our Salon would rival her own. But we don&#x2019;t have that kind of money. We are showmen, only a little better-off than the circus performers who exhibit next door.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Think of it,&#x201d; I say eagerly. &#x201c;I could arrange a special tableau for her visit. An image of the queen sitting in her dressing room. With <i>you </i>by her side. <i>The Queen and Her Minister of Fashion,&#x201d; </i>I tell her.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Rose&#x2019;s lips twitch upward. Although Minister of Fashion is an insult the papers use to criticize her influence over Marie Antoinette, it&#x2019;s not far from the truth, and she knows this. She hesitates. It is one thing to have your name in the papers, but to be immortalized in wax . . . That is something reserved only for royals and criminals, and she is neither. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what would you have me say?&#x201d; she asks slowly.<br>&nbsp;<br>My heart beats quickly. Even if the queen dislikes what I&#x2019;ve done&#x2014; and she won&#x2019;t, I <i>know </i>she won&#x2019;t, not when I&#x2019;ve taken such pains to get the blue of her eyes just right&#x2014; the fact that she has personally come to see her wax model will change everything. Our exhibition will be included in the finest guidebooks to Paris. We&#x2019;ll earn a place in every Catalog of Amusements printed in France. But most important, we&#x2019;ll be associated with Marie Antoinette. Even after all of the scandals that have attached themselves to her name, there is only good business to be had by entertaining Their Majesties. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just tell her that you&#x2019;ve been to the Salon de Cire. You have, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Rose Bertin is not a woman to miss anything. Even a wax show on the Boulevard du Temple. &#x201c;It was attractive.&#x201d; She adds belatedly, &#x201c;In its way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So tell that to the queen. Tell her I&#x2019;ve modeled the busts of Voltaire, Rousseau, Benjamin Franklin. Tell her there will be several of her. And you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Rose is silent. Then finally, she says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;</p><h2>60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Boston: Including Coastal and Interior Regions and New Hampshire</h2><p><p><b>It&#x2019;s Time to Take a Hike!</b> </p><p>The best way to experience Boston is by hiking it!

Once you&#x2019;re on the trail, head southwest, away from the road. You&#x2019;ll see it marked by the Dartmouth Natural Resource Trust (DNRT) sign. A hundred yards or so in from the road, the trail leads to a kiosk displaying a map of the reserve. Continue from here along the yellow trail to reach a three-way intersection. At this junction, turn left to hike east along the yellow trail. This trail runs roughly parallel to Fisher Road, which you can occasionally see through the loose forest of pine, oak, and maple. </p><p>Ahead where the yellow trail meets the blue trail, bear left to hike southeast behind houses on Fisher Road. Then, turning away from backyards, follow blue trail markers to the uneven terrain of a weathered esker. At the next split, bear right, switching back to the yellow trail to retreat into the deeper woods. </p><p>Becoming narrower as it runs under a canopy of trees, the trail dips and climbs then merges with another trail. Continue following the yellow trail markers. At a slightly confusing intersection, follow the path to make almost a hairpin turn and head north to stay on the yellow trail. Continue downhill off the ridge to reach another junction. Stay left and follow the wide yellow trail over level ground. The trail passes by a stream and scattered birch groves. Bear left again at the next fork to follow the yellow trail as it swings south. Snaking through the forest, the trail soon leads to a bench on a banking overlooking Destruction Brook and remnants of the millworks first established here around 1690. </p><p>From this spot, descend the banking, and turn left onto the red trail, which traces the route of the brook. Shortly this route joins the yellow trail, and the two continue as one. Passing a gate to the left, the trail curves south and crosses a wide bridge. On the opposite bank, the trails separate. Stay with the red trail, and continue hiking south. </p><p>The trail eases west to pass a white house sitting among pines on the left. Just beyond this, the trail reaches another intersection. The path to the left leads to an alternate parking spot for the reservation, and a path straight ahead leads to an open meadow. Steer away from these and stay with the red trail, bearing right. A moment later, a red arrow at knee level redirects the trail left, back on a westward course. </p><p>Here knobby American holly trees (<i>Ilex opaca</i>) punctuate the woods otherwise dominated by red oak and white pine. Many of the unique tree species have small signs marking them and explaining their scientific name and classification. Keep hiking, and up ahead the land to the left dips to a valley, while on the right it remains even with the trail, which now eases north. At the next two forks, stay left on what remains of the red trail, which is scarcely marked through here. </p><p>Dipping beside wetland on the left, the trail swings on several compass points but continues generally north. Holly trees grow more thickly along this avenue, mixing with maple, beech, and omnipresent oak and pine. At one point, the trail passes a magnificent beech tree growing flush to an equally magnificent oak. They make an interesting pair. </p><p>Weaving through wetland, the red trail eventually heads northwest to intersect the green trail. This junction is marked both with the letter D on a stone and a sign that reads &#x201c;start of green loop.&#x201d; Leave the pine-thick red trail here, and continue northwest down a slight grade on the green trail. Thick woods and a stone wall lie to the right. A few hundred yards ahead, where the trail forms a T, turn left and continue west toward a house neighboring private property. Where the trail forks a few feet farther on, bear right to hike north, tracking a stone wall built in the mid-1800s, when a farm was established on the 90 acres encircled by the green loop. </p><p>Along this section of former cart road, boughs of giant hickory trees arch overhead. Though nearly retaken by nature, the place has not yet fully given up its former self. It has been years since this land was a working farm, but midway down the path on the right, there is still a foundation for what was once a great barn. </p><p>A short distance farther, the path reaches a point where the DNRT reservation ends. The green trail continues ahead, emerging from the woods briefly as it passes privately owned land lying to the west. Watch to the east for a path leading into a thicket of pines to the Gidley Cemetery, where several who lived on this land are buried. </p><p>Trust the trail as it forges north. The way is clear, though momentarily bereft of markers. Coming to the end of the avenue draped voluminously with vines, the trail arrives at a junction. no trespassing signs rule out the paths to the left and center, leaving two paths to the right. Of these, choose the soft right, and hike southeast down a pitch. A sandpit lies ahead on the left and, in it, the carcass of a sedan pinned between two pine saplings. The trail cuts sharply away from this wreck and runs into woods of cedar and holly. Looping around the eastern side of the wetland, the trail splits briefly upon reaching an esker. For the sake of the view, bear left to ascend the 30- to 50-foot skeletal mound of glacial debris. </p><p>As the esker subsides, the land on the right falls away to a deep glade. Having the hushed feel of a room just made empty by a crowd, this natural basin held grazing cows. Scrappy trees have grown in over time, but none look as though they will ever achieve the height and girth of the tremendous oak that stands at the center. </p><p>From this old meadow, the barely marked green trail continues southeast through swales and over bumps until, bending west, it returns to the start of the loop. To complete the hike, return to the junction where the green and red trails meet, and bear left onto the red trail, heading east. Running wide and flat through wetland thick with maples, this trail is easy to follow. Plentiful red markers guide the way to Ella&#x2019;s Bridge, which lies just ahead at Destruction Brook. </p><p>Upon crossing to the opposite bank, quit the red trail, pick up the yellow trail once more, and continue straight ahead. Weaving through woods draped with curtains of bittersweet, the trail soon reaches a vibrant pine grove. Look for where the trail splits left to return to the start at Fisher Road. </p><p><b>Nearby Attractions</b> </p><p>The Lloyd Center for the Environment (430 Potomska Road, Dartmouth; 508-990- 0505; lloydcenter.org) has five walking trails over 55 acres of oak/hickory forest, freshwater wetlands, estuary, and salt marsh. From Destruction Brook Woods, drive southeast on Fisher Road 4.3 miles. Turn right onto Russell Mills Road, then turn left onto Rock O&#x2019; Dundee Road. Turn right onto Potomska Road, and continue 1.2 miles to the Lloyd Center. </p><p><b>GPS Trailhead Coordinates</b> N41� 34.800' W71� 00.950' </p><p><b>Directions</b> From Boston, take I-93 S 12 miles, then take Exit 4 on the left to merge onto MA 24 S toward Brockton. Drive 38.1 miles to Exit 4 to merge left onto I-195 east toward New Bedford. Continue 4.6 miles and take Exit 11 toward Dartmouth. Head south on Reed Road. After crossing US 6, turn left on Beeden Road. Turn right on Old Westport Road/Fisher Road, then left to stay on Fisher. Just before the fork with Woodcock Road, look for the DNRT sign for Destruction Brook Woods on the right. Park off Fisher Road near the sign; there is room for approximately six cars.</p></p><h2>Edgar Cayce on Auras &amp; Colors</h2><p>For the late psychic Edgar Cayce, the aura provided a pictorial representation of an individual s health, thoughts, talents, and life potentials as well as karmic lessons and even past lives.

From an evolutionary perspective, if normal is defined as what most people have done for millions of years, then it's normal to walk and run 9 -15 kilometers a day to hunt and gather fresh food which is high in fibre, low in sugar, and barely processed. It's also normal to spend much of your time nursing, napping, making stone tools, and gossiping with a small band of people.Our 21st-century lifestyles, argues Dan Lieberman, are out of synch with our stone-age bodies. Never have we been so healthy and long-lived - but never, too, have we been so prone to a slew of problems that were, until recently, rare or unknown, from asthma, to diabetes, to - scariest of all - overpopulation.Story of the Human Body asks how our bodies got to be the way they are, and considers how that evolutionary history - both ancient and recent - can help us evaluate how we use our bodies. How is the present-day state of the human body related to the past? And what is the human body's future?Daniel Lieberman is the Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard and a leader in the field. He has written nearly 100 articles, many appearing in the journals Nature and Science, and his cover story on barefoot running in Nature was picked up by major media the world over.

In fact, I am extremely lucky to be a professor at Harvard University, where I teach and study how and why the human body is the way it is. My job and my interests allow me to be a jack-of-all trades. In addition to working with students, I study fossils, I travel to interesting corners of the earth to see how people use their bodies, and I do experiments in the lab on how human and animal bodies work. <br>&nbsp;<br>Like most professors, I also love to talk, and I enjoy people&#x2019;s questions. But of all the questions I am commonly asked, the one I used to dread the most was &#x201c;What will human beings look like in the future?&#x201d; I hated this question! I am a professor of human evolutionary biology, which means I study the past, not what lies ahead. I am not a soothsayer, and the question made me think of tawdry science fiction movies that depict humans of the distant future as having enormous brains, pale and tiny bodies, and shiny clothing. My reflexive answer was always something along the lines of: &#x201c;Human beings aren&#x2019;t evolving very much because of culture.&#x201d; This response is a variant of the standard answer that many of my colleagues give when asked the same question.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have since changed my mind about this question and now consider the human body&#x2019;s future to be one of the most important issues we can think about. We live in paradoxical times for our bodies. On the one hand, this era is probably the healthiest in human history. If you live in a developed country, you can reasonably expect all your offspring to survive childhood, to live to their dotage, and to become parents and grandparents. We have conquered or quelled many diseases that used to kill people in droves: smallpox, measles, polio, and the plague. People are taller, and formerly life-threatening conditions like appendicitis, dysentery, a broken leg, or anemia are easily remedied. To be sure, there is still too much malnutrition and disease in some countries, but these evils are often the result of bad government and social inequality, not a lack of food or medical know-how.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the other hand, we could be doing better, much better. A wave of obesity and chronic, preventable illnesses and disabilities is sweeping across the globe. These preventable diseases include certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, some allergies, dementia, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other illnesses. Billions of people are also suffering from ailments like lower back pain, fallen arches, plantar fasciitis, myopia, arthritis, constipation, acid reflux, and irritable bowel syndrome. Some of these troubles are ancient, but many are novel or have recently exploded in prevalence and intensity. To some extent, these diseases are on the rise because people are living longer, but most of them are showing up in middle-aged people. This epidemiological transition is causing not just misery but also economic woe. As baby boomers retire, their chronic illnesses are straining health-care systems and stifling economies. Moreover, the image in the crystal ball looks bad because these diseases are also growing in prevalence as development spreads across the planet.<br>&nbsp;<br>The health challenges we face are causing an intense worldwide conversation among parents, doctors, patients, politicians, journalists, researchers, and others. Much of the focus has been on obesity. Why are people getting fatter? How do we lose weight and change our diets? How do we prevent our children from becoming overweight? How can we encourage them to exercise? Because of the urgent necessity to help people who are sick, there is also an intense focus on devising new cures for increasingly common noninfectious diseases. How do we treat and cure cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and the other illnesses most likely to kill us and the people we love?<br>&nbsp;<br>As doctors, patients, researchers, and parents debate and investigate these questions, I suspect that few of them cast their thoughts back to the ancient forests of Africa, where our ancestors diverged from the apes and stood upright. They rarely think about Lucy or Neanderthals, and if they do consider evolution it is usually to acknowledge the obvious fact that we used to be cavemen (whatever that means), which perhaps implies that our bodies are not well adapted to modern lifestyles. A patient with a heart attack needs immediate medical care, not a lesson in human evolution.<br>&nbsp;<br>If I ever suffer a heart attack, I too want my doctor to focus on the exigencies of my care rather than on human evolution. This book, however, argues that our society&#x2019;s general failure to think about human evolution is a major reason we fail to prevent preventable diseases. Our bodies have a story&#x2014;an evolutionary story&#x2014;that matters intensely. For one, evolution explains why our bodies are the way they are, and thus yields clues on how to avoid getting sick. Why are we so liable to become fat? Why do we sometimes choke on our food? Why do we have arches in our feet that flatten? Why do we have backs that ache? A related reason to consider the human body&#x2019;s evolutionary story is to help understand what our bodies are and are not adapted for. The answers to this question are tricky and unintuitive but have profound implications for making sense of what promotes health and disease and for comprehending why our bodies sometimes naturally make us sick. Finally, I think the most pressing reason to study the human body&#x2019;s story is that it isn&#x2019;t over. We are still evolving. Right now, however, the most potent form of evolution is not biological evolution of the sort described by Darwin, but cultural evolution, in which we develop and pass on new ideas and behaviors to our children, friends, and others. Some of these novel behaviors, especially the foods we eat and the activities we do (or don&#x2019;t do), make us sick.<br>&nbsp;<br>Human evolution is fun, interesting, and illuminating, and much of this book explores the amazing journey that created our bodies. I also try to highlight the progress achieved by farming, industrialization, medical science, and other professions that have made this era the best of all times so far to be a human. But I am no Pangloss, and since our challenge is to do better, the last few chapters focus on how and why we get sick. If Tolstoy were writing this book, perhaps he might write that &#x201c;all healthy bodies are alike; each unhealthy body is unhealthy in its own way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The core subjects of this book&#x2014;human evolution, health, and disease&#x2014;are enormous and complex. I have done my best to try to keep the facts, explanations, and arguments simple and clear without dumbing them down or avoiding essential issues, especially for serious diseases such as breast cancer and diabetes. I have also included many references, including websites, where you can investigate further. Another struggle was to find the right balance between breadth and depth. Why our bodies are the way they are is simply too large a topic to cover because bodies are so complex. I have therefore focused on just a few aspects of our bodies&#x2019; evolution that relate to diet and physical activity, and for every topic I cover, there are at least ten I don&#x2019;t. The same caveat applies to the final chapters, which focus on just a few diseases that I chose as exemplars of larger problems. Moreover, research in these fields is changing fast. Inevitably some of what I include will become out of date. I apologize.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, I have rashly concluded the book with my thoughts about how to apply the lessons of the human body&#x2019;s past story to its future. I&#x2019;ll spill the beans right now and summarize the core of my argument. We didn&#x2019;t evolve to be healthy, but instead we were selected to have as many offspring as possible under diverse, challenging conditions. As a consequence, we never evolved to make rational choices about what to eat or how to exercise in conditions of abundance and comfort. What&#x2019;s more, interactions between the bodies we inherited, the environments we create, and the decisions we sometimes make have set in motion an insidious feedback loop. We get sick from chronic diseases by doing what we evolved to do but under conditions for which our bodies are poorly adapted, and we then pass on those same conditions to our children, who also then get sick. If we wish to halt this vicious circle then we need to figure out how to respectfully and sensibly nudge, push, and sometimes oblige ourselves to eat foods that promote health and to be more physically active. That, too, is what we evolved to do.</p></p><h2>Death from the Skies!: The Science Behind the End of the World</h2><p>With wit, humor, and an infectious love of astronomy that could win over even the science-phobic, this fun and fascinating book reminds us that outer space is anything but remote. The scientist behind the popular website badastronomy.com, Philip Plait presents some of the most fearsome end-of-the-world calamities (for instance, incoming asteroids and planet-swallowing black holes), demystifies the scientific principles at work behind them, and gives us the odds that any of them will step out of the realm of sci-fi to disrupt our quiet corner of the cosmos. The result is a book that is both terrifying and entertaining?a tour of the violent universe we live in, written with an enthusiasm that every stargazer will appreciate.</p><p>Phil Plait, Ph.D. is a NASA-funded research astronomer with more than ten years of professional experience. He has written astronomy articles for magazines such as <i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Muse</i>, and <i>Space Illustrated</i>, and has been published in the <i>Boston Globe</i>. Plait has appeared on national radio and TV programs, including the Sci-Fi Channel&#x2019;s &#x201c;Countdown to Doomsday&#x201d; documentary.Plait, an astronomer and author of the popular Web site badastronomy.com, presents in loving detail the many, many ways the human race could die, from temperature extremes and poisonous atmosphere to asteroid impacts and supernovae explosions. Such a state of destruction existed some 65 million years ago, when a giant meteoroid struck Earth, sending up so much flaming debris that the whole planet caught fire and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Solar flare activity could bring on another Ice Age. Worse yet would be a gamma ray burster, a collapsed star whose radiation would be comparable to detonating a one-megaton nuclear bomb over every square mile of the planet. Plait discusses insatiable black holes, the death of the Sun and cannibal galaxies&#x2014;including our own. Balancing his doomsday scenarios with enthusiastic and clear explanations of the science behind each, Plait offers a surprisingly educational and enjoyable astronomical horror show, including a table listing the extremely low odds of each event occurring. He gives readers a good scare, and then puts it in context. Illus. <i>(Oct. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is a vivid testimony to a life cut short, and testimony too, to the bravery and compassion of Judy and Dennis&#x2014;Matthew&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;as they struggle to survive a grief that won&#x2019;t go away.&#x201d;&#x2014;Larry McMurty, author of <i>Terms of Endearment</i> and <i>Lonesome Dove</i></b><br><br> Today the name Matthew Shepard is synonymous with gay rights, but until 1998, he was just Judy Shepard&#x2019;s son. In this remarkably candid memoir,&nbsp;Judy Shepard shares the story behind the headlines. Interweaving memories of Matthew and her family with the challenges of confronting her son&#x2019;s death, Judy describes how she handled the crippling loss of her child in the public eye, the vigils and protests held by strangers in her son&#x2019;s name, and ultimately how she and her husband gained the courage to help prosecutors convict her son's murderers. <br><br><i>The Meaning of Matthew</i> is more than a retelling of horrific injustice that brought the reality of inequality and homophobia into the American consciousness. It is an&nbsp;unforgettable and inspiring account of how one ordinary woman turned an unthinkable tragedy into a vital message for the world.</p><p><b>Judy Shepard</b> is cofounder of the Matthew Shepard Foundation, which is dedicated to social justice, diversity awareness and education, and equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people. Shepard speaks across the country on behalf of the foundation.The brutal murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998 in Laramie, Wyoming, brought violence based on sexual orientation to public view. His mother, determined that Matthew&#39;s life should have meaning, has become an activist for the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crime legislation (the federal act, named for Matthew, was enacted in October 2009) and for gay rights in general. Judy Shepard&#39;s narration is consistent with her statements in the book that in various public situations she is determined not to break down--as she wants the focus of the story to be Matthew, not her. Matthew&#39;s father delivers the statement he made at the trial of one of the assailants. Both parents read in tightly controlled voices that are poignant and, by the absence of dramatization, tell a haunting story.

He&#x2019;s also the founder of one of the best wine bars in Paris: � Chateau.LE TERROIR<br><br>Understanding France-and wine while you're at it-requires being acquainted with a word the French language had the elegance to give birth to and to nurture. That word is terroir.<br><br>Ask a wine lover what makes a great bottle of wine so great: le terroir. Why is this winemaker so excited about this small little parcel on that particular hill? Le terroir. What is so wonderful about Burgundy or Piemonte? Le terroir. Le terroir is somewhereness; it is the essence of a place, its signature. It is what's unique, nonreproducible, and singular about it.<br><br>In the world of wine, this translates into the unique combination of soil, subsoil, climate, topology, etc., all of which contribute to giving a unique taste to the grapes and therefore ultimately to the wine produced in that particular place. French wine is so complex and diverse because, to the very core of how it is organized, farmed, and sold, it values terroir. In France, names of places-not of grapes-define wine. People in France order Bordeaux, Beaujolais, Sancerre, and Champagne, which are all regions, not Merlot, Pinot Noir, or Sauvignon Blanc, which all refer to grape varieties! Wine, for the French, is about where it's from far more than about what grape(s) it's made from.<br><br>Ultimately, terroir is what makes one place different from another. The terroir of the American South at the beginning of the last century gave us jazz, just like that of the Bronx in the 1980s gave us hip-hop.<br><br>France is home to countless terroirs, which have been shaped over millennia. It is also home to a culture that recognizes, appreciates, and sometimes even reveres them. Anyone who has traveled extensively through France can grasp the tremendous variety in architecture, cuisine, wine, accents, crops, sports, and cultural references from one French region to the next. Normandy is immediately and irremediably distinguishable from Alsace, in the same way that Provence is different from Brittany, or Corsica from the Alps.<br><br>Most French people are gourmands, so when they travel to these regions, they have high expectations. Go to Normandy and your intake of Calvados and cider will automatically increase. Visit Brittany and cr?pes will be your passage oblig . Head to Marseille: bouillabaisse and ros wine will most likely be on the menu. Off to Alsace? You'd miss out by not sipping Alsatian wine or beer while enjoying a good choucroute.<br><br>While the expression of terroir in the world of wine-since it is complex, extremely varied, and thus requires some getting acquainted with-makes many people consider French wine as "too complicated," visiting France shows how wonderfully diverse, tasty, and unpretentious the culture of terroir truly is.<br><br>In a global world that threatens to obliterate differences, recognizing, appreciating, and seeking expressions of terroir-whether in wine, food, music, architecture, or language-are the ticket to a more delectable and richer life. If wine has one thing to teach us, it really is the beauty and value of le terroir. For while the word is French, the reality is not. Terroirs are everywhere. So come along, dear reader, and join the joyful bunch known as the terroirists!<br><br>Useful tip: If you want to experience wines that express their terroir the most, ask for "biodynamic" wines at your local wine store.<br><br>Sound like a French person: "L'amour du terroir, c'est important quand m?me dans la culture fran?aise." (The love of terroir-it's actually an important part of French culture.)<br><br>L'AP&#x192;RO<br><br>There is no understanding French culture without understanding the paramount importance of l'ap ritif.<br><br>L'ap ritif is the moment preceding a meal when drinks and finger food are consumed. It's the warm-up, the buildup, the foreplay before a meal. In and of itself, the mere existence of the concept of drinks and food before drinks and food should suffice to guarantee an irrevocable spot for France in the hall of fame of the world's greatest nations.<br><br>The ap ritif is an absolute landmark of French culture-and is typically referred to by its familiar nickname l'ap ro. It is essential to realize that even though food can be served, l'ap ro is really about the drinking. Heck, French supermarkets even have a section of the drinks aisle called ap ritifs, where all the traditional ap ro drinks are gathered.<br><br>Meals in France are a serious matter-you should ease into them. L'ap ro is that buffer between the harshness of nonmeal life and the pleasant parenthetical that a proper French meal should be. It is about transitioning to your more relaxed, more social, and more joyful self.<br><br>Prendre l'ap ro is more about sharing a moment than just having a drink. It's about taking the time to do it. So the first thing your server should ask after you are seated at a French restaurant is: "Un ap ritif pour commencer?" That is one legitimate question!<br><br>It is essential to pick up signals when it comes to the ap ro culture. If a friend offers you an ap ritif for lunch on a weekday, the plan is clear: boozy lunch. Not much solid work is going to be achieved that afternoon. At night, ap ros can be had solo at home to take the edge off, or with friends or colleagues, or at a bar. Girls like to have un p'tit ap ro entre filles (a girls-only ap ro), while guys typically prefer un ap ro entre mecs (a guys-only ap ro). What is served depends on social class, trends, regions, and seasons. During spring and summer, ap ro rhymes with ros .<br><br>Go to the South of France and pastis (and its derivatives like mauresque) will be your go-to ap ro drink. In Burgundy, kir (black currant liqueur mixed with white wine) is the traditional choice. Climb the social ladder and l'ap ritif is equated with Champagne. Head to Martinique, Guadeloupe, or R union Island and rum will dominate the scene. Foodwise, anything could potentially be on offer, from sad little cacahou?tes (peanuts) all the way to fancy amuse-bouches. The most common option is simply g&#x2030;teaux ap ritif-think a better, more eclectic version of crackers (which undoubtedly constitute another very French section of local supermarkets). Every French person is highly familiar with the few typical g&#x2030;teaux ap ritif, and everyone has a favorite (e.g., les Curly, les Tucs, etc.).<br><br>When French people have friends or family over, l'ap ritif is an essential part of the event. It is not held at the dinner table and requires a separate venue (outside, on the sofa, by the coffee table, etc.). Only once l'ap ro is finished (and the food is ready) will guests be asked to sit down for the meal.<br><br>L'ap ro is such a pleasant time of any French social experience that it has morphed into an experience in and of itself. It went independent! Over the past few years, l'ap ro stopped simply preceding meals and started to frequently supplant them.<br><br>L'ap ritif d&#x201d;natoire was born: no formal dinner, but enough food to satisfy all guests. Many corporate events or family affairs now take the form of more flexible and mingly ap ritifs d&#x201d;natoires.<br><br>But the real fun in the new, reinvented world of ap ritifs is to be had by the younger crowd. Younger French people don't do dinner parties as much as their elders, frequently lacking the time, space, money, desire, or cooking skills. Yet they love to meet up for un ap ro. There is something very open and noncommittal about it that fits the Millennial lifestyle. The invitation implies that everyone can leave early or invite friends. It also implies that things can get wild and go all night if the vibe is right. No definite script. The atmosphere is usually more relaxed than more formal social functions, so ap ros tend to be great fun and may end up lasting even longer than your good old traditional French meal. Incorrigible Frenchies!<br><br>Useful tip: Always bring a bottle of wine. Not too fancy.<br><br>Sound like a French person: "On fait un ap ro vendredi soir. Tu veux passer?" (We're having an ap ro Friday night. Wanna stop by?)<br><br>FRENCH DANCING<br><br>You may be surprised to find that there is such a thing as French dancing.<br><br>It can be summed up in two words: bad dancing.<br><br>In France, dancing is about acknowledging the music. Following it is secondary. Who's that good at dancing anyway? In France, just getting your body in motion will qualify you as an utterly fun person. A French party animal is just someone that moves some body parts when she hears music. Coordination is irrelevant. It is quite okay to look bad. It is actually okay to look like you might-just possibly-suffer from some mild and heretofore discreet mental affliction. The French are open-minded like that. Here, there is always a mild feeling of relief when the music stops and people get back to normal: they were not impaired; they were just French!<br><br>Now, while the majority of French people specialize in erratic motions, some step it up a notch. On the dance floor, these ones do not look like they might have a disease; they just suck. When it comes to dance skills, plain sucking will make you one of the best dancers in France. No questions asked. You're a natural.<br><br>French dancing is primarily arm dancing. Sooner or later, French dancing will provide the observer with the ultimate French dance move: the arms-up move. When the chorus of a song comes up, 80 percent of the people on the dance floor will raise their arms to the sky-again, most likely not in time with the music. For the most energetic people or the greatest tunes, their bodies will follow their arms skyward and then their feet toward the ground. The French will start jumping along with the music.<br><br>That moment is the peak of a French party. If your guests leave without jumping with their arms up in the air, the party-no matter what the guests may say-was just a little underwhelming. A party climax in France is all about the jumping.<br><br>Extra cool points will be scored by those raising only one arm. This tricky maneuver is typically employed by smokers or people holding a drink. Double score if you can hold both a cigarette and a drink while raising one or two arms. You are obviously incredibly coordinated and so, indeed, just plain cool.<br><br>Some social groups have decided not to let their Frenchness deter them from owning the dance floors. As such, they have specialized in a specific type of dancing, which incidentally will give them away immediately. Here are a few of these other types of dancing &#x2c6; la fran?aise:<br><br>Dance le rock and you are no doubt about it un bourge-spawn of the dying breed known as the proper French Catholic bourgeoisie. Rock dancing can be fun and sometimes impressive to watch. Usually, however, even when fully mastered, it is rendered with no rhythm whatsoever. Mechanical masterpiece, groove tragedy.<br><br>Dance la tectonique and you'll be viewed as un jeune-a youngster. Older people will lament that, in their day, you didn't dance on your own; you had a companion. Young adults will look down on you for mastering something they don't, and that reminds them they're no longer on the cutting edge. They will try to bust one or two moves, jokingly. French soft hilarity typically ensues.<br><br>Dance le hip-hop and you're une racaille-a hoodlum. While twenty years ago outliers would faire du modern-jazz, now the new generation of young French girls fait du hip-hop. In all fairness, though, it should be noted that, thanks to the spread of hip-hop culture, France is home to some of the best hip-hop dancers in the world.<br><br>On the subject of dancing, one thing has become clear to most young French people: Les Am ricaines, elles dansent comme des putes-American girls dance like prostitutes. Young French boys will join in with awe and excitement evident on their faces, while French girls will offer some of the most disgusted-looking Gallic shrugs of your life. Contempt and jealousy combined will do that.<br><br>At that point, they'll go back to the dance floor acting like they'd rather be somewhere else.<br><br>Compared with many other cultures, the French culture does not grant a significant role to dancing. While many French girls take dance classes in their childhood and find dancing fun, most Frenchmen dread it. The dance floor at a typical French wedding will frequently be filled with women only. Occasionally, a few girls will try to drag their dates or husbands out of their chairs. Actual pulling will occur. Usually unsuccessfully.<br><br>Frenchmen prefer to stay seated and drink the night away with their buddies: "J'aime pas danser. Putain, pourquoi elle m'emmerde?" (I don't like dancing. Damn, why is she bugging me?)<br><br>Useful tip: If you are a good dancer and a woman, you will become the center of attention on any French dance floor.<br><br>Sound like a French person: "Moi j'aime beaucoup danser mais avec Michel, c'est vrai que c'est pas tous les jours!" (I love to dance, but with Michel, it's only once in a blue moon!)<br><br>BLOWING AIR<br><br>Among humans, most communication is nonverbal. Among French people, however, a fair bit of the nonverbal communication remains mouth-centric.<br><br>While unmistakably French mouth shrugs are a well-known Gallic trait, another essential mouth movement escapes the sagacity of most visitors and observers.<br><br>That movement consists of blowing air.<br><br>Short of an attentive study of the French air-blowing ways, foreigners will miss the bulk of the small refinements that make up the richness and depth of social interactions in France.<br><br>Several emotional states can be expressed much more conveniently through blowing air than by using words. Blowing air can mean a number of different things:<br><br>1. "I'm impressed!" To show that you are impressed, curve your mouth, both corners pulled downward (think sad smiley face). Keep your lips relaxed. Then push air out gently through the tips of your lips. Once. A small, lean sound will ensue. Accompany this sound and movement by a nod and/or chickenlike tilt. That, right there, is French for "Wow-that's amazing."<br><br>2. "I have no idea." French people typically have the answer to most questions. In the rare occurrence that they happen not to, they shall express it through air blowing. To achieve a nonverbal Je ne sais pas, repeat the movement explained above and add to it a concomitant shoulder shrug. Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>3. "I'm frustrated." Acting frustrated being so quintessential to Frenchness, it is key to be able to recognize and communicate that state of mind efficiently. Fortunately, it is a piece of g&#x2030;teau. The pattern is as follows: Inhale through your nose; then expel that breath through the mouth in a generous, continuous, louder-than-usual blow. Once this general frame is understood, small variations will open the doors to truly blending in. In order to capture or express the wide palette of the French forms of frustration, one must focus on two things: the level of intensity and the shape of the lips.</p><h2>The Naval Institute Guide to Naval Writing, 3rd Editio (Blue &amp; Gold Professional Library)</h2><p>Written by a naval officer who taught English at two service academies, this is the third edition of the premier guide to professional writing for the naval services.

Heralded as the Marian Age, the past two hundred years have been blessed with numerous appearances of Our Lady, each one offering messages of inspiration and hope and urging the world to return to the love of God through prayer, penance, and reparation for sins.<br><br><i>A Woman Clothed with the Sun </i>considers the seven most significant apparitions of Our Lady in the past two centuries: that of the Miraculous Medal at Paris, those at La Salette, Lourdes, Knock, Fatima, Beauraing, Banneux--and also the sixteenth-century appearance of Mary at Guadalupe with its profound message for Americans.

It is a manifesto against mass society, arguing against raw, ripe, democracy, here (in the US), there (in South Africa), and everywhere. Into the Cannibal&#39;s Pot follows Russell Kirk&#39;s contention that true freedom can be found only within the framework of a social order. It is a reminder that, however imperfect, civilized societies are fragile. They can, and will, crumble in culturally inhospitable climes. The tyranny of political correctness, so unique to the West plays a role in their near-collapse. Advanced societies don&#39;t just die; they either wither from within, or, like South Africa, are finished off by other western societies. Ilana Mercer delivers a compelling book; it is required reading for thinking people who care about the destiny of western civilization.</p><p>This is a book about ideas and ideology. When losing an intellectual argument, there are despicable people who point an accusing finger and shout racism. In our dark times where mob rule and collectivist ideas resonate with so many, this appalling strategy can be very effective. To those who support colorblind civil discourse, rule of law, equality of opportunity, freedom, the golden rule (do unto others as you wish them to do unto you), liberty, freedom of expression and religion and private property rights...regardless of skin color or ethnic background (black, red, white, yellow, brown, green or violet), we extend the hand of friendship. To those who support all forms of thuggery-- including totalitarianism, collectivism, fascism, extremist fundamentalism, unequal treatment under law, income redistribution, nanny state government programs and the soft bigotry of low expectations-- your skin color and ethnicity are irrelevant...and your ideas belong in the dustbin of history.Dedicated to my Afrikaner brothers betrayed, and to my African sisters, Nomasomi Khala and Annie Dlahmini, whose lives touched mine.</p><h2>Being Made Ready: The Outworking of Our Part in the Millennial Kingdom of God</h2><p><p>At the heart of this devotional is the desire to present the anointed Word as a guide that will lead those who have a singular burning desire to go further... &#x201c;into a kingdom relationship&#x201d; with Jesus in the outworking of their part with Him in the Millennial Kingdom.</p> <p>Our devotional life is extremely important, as it includes not only our times of prayer, meditation in the Word, and communion with the Lord, but through these &#x201c;set apart times&#x201d; there is imparted into our being a strength that contains spiritual life and substance.</p> <p>These devotions are intended to guide you into a higher level of spiritual life and experience.

The full report<br>has been provided to the White House, the CIA, the Department of<br>Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and<br>the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the hopes that<br>it will prevent future coercive interrogation practices and inform the<br>management of other covert action programs.<br><br>As the Chairman of the Committee since 2009, I write to offer<br>some additional views, context, and history.<br><br>I began my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee in<br>January 2001. I remember testimony that summer from George Tenet,<br>the Director of Central Intelligence, that warned of a possible<br>major terrorist event against the United States, but without specifics<br>on the time, location, or method of attack. On September 11, 2001, the<br>world learned the answers to those questions that had consumed the<br>CIA and other parts of the U.S. Intelligence Community.*<br>* For information on the events at the CIA prior to September 11, 2001, see the Final<br>Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (9/11<br>Commission) and Office of the Inspector General Report on Accountability With Respect<br>to the 9/11 Attacks.<br><br>I recall vividly watching the horror of that day, to include the<br>television footage of innocent men and women jumping out of the<br>World Trade Center towers to escape the fire. The images, and<br>the sounds as their bodies hit the pavement far below, will remain<br>with me for the rest of my life.<br><br>It is against that backdrop&#x2014;the largest attack against the<br>American homeland in our history&#x2014;that the events described in this<br>report were undertaken.<br><br>Nearly thirteen years later, the Executive Summary and Findings<br>and Conclusions of this report are being released. They are highly<br>critical of the CIA&#x2019;s actions, and rightfully so. Reading them, it is easy<br>to forget the context in which the program began&#x2014;not that the context<br>should serve as an excuse, but rather as a warning for the future.<br>It is worth remembering the pervasive fear in late 2001 and how<br>immediate the threat felt. Just a week after the September 11 attacks,<br>powdered anthrax was sent to various news organizations and to two<br>U.S. Senators. The American public was shocked by news of new<br>terrorist plots and elevations of the color-coded threat level of the<br>Homeland Security Advisory System. We expected further attacks<br>against the nation.<br><br>I have attempted throughout to remember the impact on the<br>nation and to the CIA workforce from the attacks of September 11,<br>2001. I can understand the CIA&#x2019;s impulse to consider the use of every<br>possible tool to gather intelligence and remove terrorists from the<br>battlefield,* and CIA was encouraged by political leaders and the public<br>to do whatever it could to prevent another attack.<br><br>The Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence<br>agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events.<br>Nevertheless, such pressure, fear, and expectation of further terrorist<br>plots do not justify, temper, or excuse improper actions taken<br>by individuals or organizations in the name of national security. The<br>major lesson of this report is that regardless of the pressures and the<br>need to act, the Intelligence Community&#x2019;s actions must always reflect<br>who we are as a nation, and adhere to our laws and standards. It is<br>precisely at these times of national crisis that our government must be<br>guided by the lessons of our history and subject decisions to internal<br>and external review.<br><br>Instead, CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided<br>to initiate a program of indefinite secret detention and the use<br>* It is worth repeating that covert action authorities approved by the President in September 2001 did not provide any authorization or contemplate coercive interrogations.<br><br>This Committee Study documents the abuses and countless<br>mistakes made between late 2001 and early 2009. The Executive<br>Summary of the Study provides a significant amount of new information,<br>based on CIA and other documents, to what has already<br>been made public by the Bush and Obama Administrations, as well<br>as non-governmental organizations and the press.<br>The Committee&#x2019;s full Study is more than ten times the length<br>of the Executive Summary and includes comprehensive and excruciating<br>detail. The Study describes the history of the CIA&#x2019;s Detention<br>and Interrogation Program from its inception to its termination, including<br>a review of each of the 119 known individuals who were held<br>in CIA custody.<br><br>The full Committee Study also provides substantially more detail<br>than what is included in the Executive Summary on the CIA&#x2019;s<br>justification and defense of its interrogation program on the basis<br>that it was necessary and critical to the disruption of specific terrorist<br>plots and the capture of specific terrorists. While the Executive<br>Summary provides sufficient detail to demonstrate the inaccuracies<br>of each of these claims, the information in the full Committee Study<br>is far more extensive.<br><br>I chose not to seek declassification of the full Committee Study<br>at this time. I believe that the Executive Summary includes enough<br>information to adequately describe the CIA&#x2019;s Detention and Interrogation<br>Program, and the Committee&#x2019;s Findings and Conclusions<br>cover the entirety of the program. Seeking declassification of<br>the more than six thousand page report would have significantly<br>delayed the release of the Executive Summary. Decisions will be<br>made later on the declassification and release of the full 6,700-page<br>Study.<br><br>In 2009, when this effort began, I stated (in a press release coauthored<br>with the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kit<br>Bond) that &#x201c;the purpose is to review the program and to shape detention<br>and interrogation policies in the future.&#x201d; The review is now<br>done. It is my sincere and deep hope that through the release of these<br>Findings and Conclusions and Executive Summary that U.S. policy<br>will never again allow for secret indefinite detention and the use of<br>coercive interrogations. As the Study describes, prior to the attacks of<br>September 2001, the CIA itself determined from its own experience<br>with coercive interrogations, that such techniques &#x201c;do not produce<br>x intelligence,&#x201d; &#x201c;will probably result in false answers,&#x201d; and had historically<br>proven to be ineffective. Yet these conclusions were ignored. We<br>cannot again allow history to be forgotten and grievous past mistakes<br>to be repeated.<br><br>President Obama signed Executive Order 13491 in January 2009<br>to prohibit the CIA from holding detainees other than on a &#x201c;shortterm,<br>transitory basis&#x201d; and to limit interrogation techniques to those<br>included in the Army Field Manual. However, these limitations are<br>not part of U.S. law and could be overturned by a future president<br>with the stroke of a pen. They should be enshrined in legislation.<br>Even so, existing U.S. law and treaty obligations should have<br>prevented many of the abuses and mistakes made during this program.<br>While the Office of Legal Counsel found otherwise between<br>2002 and 2007, it is my personal conclusion that, under any common<br>meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured. I also believe<br>that the conditions of confinement and the use of authorized and<br>unauthorized interrogation and conditioning techniques were cruel,<br>inhuman, and degrading. I believe the evidence of this is overwhelming<br>and incontrovertible.<br><br>While the Committee did not make specific recommendations,<br>several emerge from the Committee&#x2019;s review. The CIA, in its June<br>2013 response to the Committee&#x2019;s Study from December 2012, has<br>also already made and begun to implement its own recommendations.<br>I intend to work with Senate colleagues to produce recommendations<br>and to solicit views from the readers of the Committee Study.<br>I would also like to take this opportunity to describe the process<br>of this study.<br><br>As noted previously, the Committee approved the Terms of<br>Reference for the Study in March 2009 and began requesting information<br>from the CIA and other federal departments. The Committee,<br>through its staff, had already reviewed in 2008 thousands<br>of CIA cables describing the interrogations of the CIA detainees<br>Abu Zubaydah and &#x2018;Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, whose interrogations<br>were the subject of videotapes that were destroyed by the CIA<br>in 2005.<br><br>The 2008 review was complicated by the existence of a Department<br>of Justice investigation, opened by Attorney General Michael<br>Mukasey, into the destruction of the videotapes and expanded by Attorney<br>General Holder in August 2009. In particular, CIA employees<br>and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the<br>Committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore<br>the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the Committee.<br>This constraint lasted until the Committee&#x2019;s research and<br>documentary review were completed and the Committee Study had<br>largely been finalized.<br><br>Furthermore, given the volume and internal nature of relevant<br>CIA documents, the CIA insisted that the Committee enter into an<br>arrangement where our staff would review documents and conduct<br>research at a CIA-leased facility rather than at the<br>Committee&#x2019;s offices on Capitol Hill.<br><br>From early 2009 to late 2012, a small group of Committee staff<br>reviewed the more than six million pages of CIA materials, to include<br>operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and<br>emails, briefing materials, interview transcripts, contracts, and other<br>records. Draft sections of the Study were prepared and distributed to<br>the full Committee membership beginning in October 2011 and this<br>process continued through to the Committee&#x2019;s vote to approve the<br>full Committee Study on December 13, 2012.<br><br>The breadth of documentary material on which the Study relied<br>and which the Committee Study cites is unprecedented. While<br>the Committee did not interview CIA officials in the context of<br>the Committee Study, it had access to and drew from the interviews<br>of numerous CIA officials conducted by the CIA&#x2019;s Inspector<br>General and the CIA Oral History program on subjects that lie at<br>the heart of the Committee Study, as well as past testimony to the<br>Committee.<br><br>Following the December 2012 vote, the Committee Study was<br>sent to the President and appropriate parts of the Executive Branch<br>for comments by February 15, 2013. The CIA responded in late June<br>2013 with extensive comments on the Findings and Conclusions,<br>based in part on the responses of CIA officials involved in the program.<br>At my direction, the Committee staff met with CIA representatives<br>in order to fully understand the CIA&#x2019;s comments, and then<br>incorporated suggested edits or comments as appropriate.<br>The Committee Study, including the now-declassified Executive<br>Summary and Findings and Conclusions, as updated is now final<br>and represents the official views of the Committee. This and future<br>Administrations should use this Study to guide future programs, correct<br>past mistakes, increase oversight of CIA representations to policymakers,<br>and ensure coercive interrogation practices are not used by<br>our government again.<br><br>Finally, I want to recognize the members of the staff who have<br>endured years of long hours poring through the difficult details of<br>one of the lowest points in our nation&#x2019;s history. They have produced<br>the most significant and comprehensive oversight report in the Committee&#x2019;s<br>history, and perhaps in that of the U.S. Senate, and their<br>contributions should be recognized and praised.<br>Daniel Jones has managed and led the Committee&#x2019;s review<br>effort from its inception. Dan has devoted more than six years to<br>this effort, has personally written thousands of its pages, and has<br>been integrally involved in every Study decision. Evan Gottesman,<br>Chad Tanner, and Alissa Starzak have also played integral roles in the<br>Committee Study and have spent considerable years researching and<br>drafting specific sections of the Committee Study.<br>Other Committee staff members have also assisted in the review<br>and provided valuable contributions at the direction of our<br>Committee Members. They include, among others, Jennifer Barrett,<br>Nick Basciano, Michael Buchwald, Jim Catella, Eric Chapman, John<br>Dickas, Lorenzo Goco, Andrew Grotto, Tressa Guenov, Clete Johnson,<br>Michael Noblet, Michael Pevzner, Tommy Ross, Caroline Tess,<br>and James Wolfe.

In this modernized, abridged, and edited version of Jeremiah Burroughs's classic Gospel Worship, the Christian is taught what God sees as sincere and hypocritical worship. "Gospel Worship has greatly influenced my understanding of biblical worship. It is one of the most important books I have ever read." -Dr. R.C. Sproul, founder and president of Ligonier Ministries "In contrast to the 'how-to' books and the superficial, almost sound-bite treatments that are so typical of our day, Burroughs forces the reader to think deeply about God and God&#x2019;s holiness and the implications of this for our worship."-David Burke, Senior Pastor, Ortega Presbyterian Church</p><p> If any book speaks prophetically to the contemporary crisis of worship in our churches, it is Burroughs  Gospel Worship. It is must reading for all concerned about honoring God in worship.  ~ R.C. SproulJeremiah Burroughs (1599-1646) <p>It is perhaps the greatest tribute to Jeremiah Burroughs that his contemporaries held him in such high esteem. No less men of renown than Thomas Goodwin, William Greenhill, and William Bridge published six volumes of writings after his death because of their regard for his piety. </p> <p>Jeremiah Burroughs was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He was a colleague to Edmund Calamy at Bury St. Edmunds. He was rector at St. Margaret�s, Tivetshall from 1631-1636, a church that is still standing in Suffold. Because of his non-conformity, he fled to Holland and settled at Rotterdam where he was a colleague of William Bridge. Upon his return to England, he was chosen preacher to the congregations at Stepney and Cripplegate in London, two of the largest congregations in all of England. </p> <p>A member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, Burroughs was also beloved for his gentle spirit. Richard Baxter said of him, "If all the Episcopalians had been like Archbishop Ussher, all the Presbyterians like Mr. Stephen Marshall, and all the Independents like Jeremiah Burroughs, the breaches of the church would soon have been healed.</p></p><h2>Graphic Style: From Victorian to Hipster</h2><p>This visual survey of graphic design styles through the ages is an essential resource for designers, art and design students, and art lovers.

With more than 60 years experience as a psychic - 20 of which have been spent studying angels - the author answers these and other often-asked questions.</p><p>SYLVIA BROWNE was born in Kansas City, Missouri. At three years old, Sylvia&#39;s psychic powers were revealed when she announced that her grandfather was dead (he was), and that she would have a baby sister in three years. Just as predicted, Sharon was born one month short of Sylvia&#39;s sixth birthday. Sylvia&#39;s grandmother, Ada Coil, was herself a medium; and Celeste, Sylvia&#39;s mother, grew up in a home where visions were commonplace. Although she herself was not psychic, Celeste accepted it as normal, if somewhat annoying. She did not welcome more eccentricity in her life, however, and would do nothing to encourage it in her daughter. Their lifelong relationship was strained, but Sylvia&#39;s relationship with her father was very close and loving. Millions of people have witnessed Sylvia Browne&#39;s incredible psychic powers on TV shows such as Montel, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, and Unsolved Mysteries; and she has been profiled in Cosmopolitan, People magazine, and other national media. Sylvia is the author of numerous books and audios; is president of the Sylvia Browne Corporation; and is the founder of her church, the Society of Novus Spiritus, located in Campbell, California.</p><h2>Washington on Foot, Fifth Edition: 24 Walking Tours and Maps of Washington, DC, Old Town Alexandria, and Takoma Park</h2><p>The best way to see&#x2014;<i>really</i> see&#x2014;any city is on foot.

The arm was adopted from a Norwegian design in 1892 and reached the troops starting in mid-1894. The American Krag Rifle and Carbine provides the arms collector, historian and target shooter with a part-by-part analysis of what has been called the &#34;rifle with the smoothest bolt action ever designed.&#34; Each of the fifteen models of the American Krag rifle and carbine are described in detail. All changes to all parts are described and matched to serial number ranges. A monthly serial number chart by production year has been devised that will provide the collector with the year and month in which his rifle or carbine was manufactured. The mystery of the so-called Philippine Constabulary rifles is solved and the &#34;School&#34; rifle is introduced. A new and complete exploded view is included as are instructions for assembly and disassembly of the rifle and carbine. It was the ideal time to introduce a new rifle. The U.S. Army in the mid-1890s was a peacetime organization. The frontier had been settled in the late 1880s and the Army had been reduced in strength to not quite 18,000 strong, and was scattered halfway around the world from Plattsburgh, New York to Anchorage, Alaska to Honolulu, Hawaii. All but two troops of cavalry were still stationed west of the Mississippi River and no military formations in regimental strength had been assembled since the Sioux Wars in 1876-1877. The Krag was the first precision-machined, small caliber, magazine loading rifle adopted by the U.S. Army. This meant that the production facilities and work force had to be completely rebuilt and reorganized. In just four short years, the entire U.S. Army, both mounted and dismounted branches, were completely equipped with the new rifle and carbine. So successful had been the design and initial production phase, that only minor changes were made to the rifle and carbine afterward. The combination of Spanish imperialism in Cuba and the sinking of the battleship, USS Maine, led the United States into a short, sharp war in 1898 that gave way to a longer, more bitter fight in the Philippines. In 1900, Chinese revolutionaries styled the &#34;Boxers&#34; threatened to murder all foreigners in China. The U.S. Army and Marines brought their Krag rifles to mainland China in concert with forces from other European nations and quickly relieved the siege of the Foreign Legations at Peking and then helped clear the country of insurgents. Even though the Krag only served the U.S. Army for eleven years, it did so admirably and saw much hard fighting. It only gave way to the Model 1903 Springfield as the latter rifle could be loaded quickly and easily with a five round clip of more powerful ammunition.</p><p>Joe Poyer is the author of more than 400 magazine articles on firearms, the modern military, military history and personal security.

Not only can this help you select an appropriate time to commence training, it can also help you to understand and troubleshoot any problems you may face both now and in the future.<br><br>The excretory system is responsible for the elimination of waste from our bodies-primarily, urine (pee) and stools (poo). Let's take a look at how each of these works in turn.<br><br>Urinary excretion<br><br>Urine is excreted in order to eliminate the waste products of cell metabolism. It also regulates blood pressure, volume and pH, and the levels of ions such as potassium, sodium, and chloride in the body.<br><br>Urine is formed in the kidneys, a pair of small bean-shaped organs located in the upper abdomen, toward the back. Organic waste is removed by the nephron, the basic functional unit of the kidney, which filters certain objects out of the body that are not needed, while reabsorbing those that are. This process uses around 25 percent of the body's cardiac output, or blood flow. The major waste product filtered out by the kidneys is known as urea, a toxic substance formed mainly from the ammonia made by the liver during the breakdown of amino acids.<br><br>After the process of secretion and reabsorption that occurs in the nephrons, waste substances travel to the collecting tubules, where they will later be excreted in urine. Urine is mostly composed of excess water, as well as urea, excess ions, and other waste products. The amount of urine produced by the body, per kilogram of weight, reduces as we age. Newborns produce 3 ml/kg per hour, while older babies produce around 2 ml/kg and toddlers produce 1.5 ml/kg per hour. Older children produce 1 ml/kg per hour, and adults produce approximately 0.5 ml/kg per hour.<br><br>The urine next passes from the kidneys through to the ureters (two tubes of smooth muscle fiber, around 30 centimeters long when fully grown) and, finally, the bladder. The bladder is a hollow, muscular, and distensible (elastic) organ that sits at the base of the pelvis. Urine leaves the bladder via the urethra, a muscular tube. Bladder capacity increases with age, until at adulthood it can hold approximately 455 ml of urine. The following table shows the capacity of the bladder at the different ages predominantly covered in this book.<br><br>Bladder capacity by age<br><br>Age of child Bladder capacity<br><br>Six months 85 ml<br><br>Twelve months 115 ml<br><br>Eighteen months 142 ml<br><br>Two years 200 ml<br><br>Three years 213 ml<br><br>Four years 227 ml<br><br>Adult 455 ml<br><br>The process and control of urination<br><br>The neck-or section close to the opening-of the bladder is held closed by two strong bands of muscle. These are known as the internal and external sphincters. The internal sphincter is made from smooth muscle that contracts involuntarily. The external sphincter is formed of skeletal muscle and is voluntarily controlled; that is, the individual can open and close it on demand.<br><br>When the bladder is full, it signals to the parasympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, contracts a layer of the bladder composed of smooth, involuntary muscle fibers known as the detrusor muscle, causing the internal sphincter to open, ready to excrete urine. Actual urination itself is a combined response of both the parasympathetic nervous system (the part that regulates the body's unconscious actions, such as digestion) and the central nervous system, or CNS (consisting of the brain and spinal cord). This teamwork causes the internal and external sphincters to open. It is the voluntarily, CNS-controlled external sphincter that is particularly important in potty training.<br><br>It is not just the external sphincter, however, that is related to potty training but the detrusor muscle. Babies commonly urinate frequently, in small amounts. Around a third will show something known as "interrupted voiding." This is characterized by incomplete urination of varying amounts and frequency. This is due to unsustained muscular contractions of the bladder, which are, in turn, believed to be a result of poor coordination between the detrusor muscle and the sphincters of the bladder. This lack of coordination may indicate that control of the bladder in early infancy is related to connections in the developing brain rather than the detrusor muscle simply stretching and causing the internal sphincter to open, as happens later in life. This suggests that urination in babies is not completely conscious or voluntary but rather related to their brain development, like the conscious and voluntary control of their limbs and movements in the early months. This pattern disappears completely by toddlerhood when the nervous system matures. Their new neurological maturity enables the toddler's and preschooler's brain to receive and send messages to the bladder, preventing urination from occurring automatically before they have found a potty or a toilet.<br><br>Control of urinary output at night<br><br>Nocturnal urinary output is controlled by the body's circadian rhythm, or body clock. At night, the lowering and, finally, absence of light is detected by the optic nerves, in the eyes, which transmit a signal to the hypothalamus and pineal gland in the brain. This signal causes several changes within the body, including:<br><br>the secretion of melatonin-a hormone that causes sleepiness<br><br>the lowering of body temperature<br><br>the increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin.<br><br>Secretion of ADH causes the body to reabsorb more water and thus reduce production of urine at night. ADH is also a vasoconstrictor, which means that it constricts blood vessels within the body, leading to higher blood pressure. This is necessary for the increased reabsorption of water at night. There is some evidence to show that in instances of persistent enuresis (bed-wetting), ADH levels are lower than in children who are dry at night; however, they are not so different that this could be considered the sole cause of bed-wetting.<br><br>When thinking about babies and toddlers, it is important to understand the development of the circadian rhythm. Research shows that it develops as children grow-that is, the circadian rhythm of a baby is not comparable to that of an adult. It is estimated that circadian rhythm becomes established to the level of an adult by around three years of age. This maturation coincides with control of the levels of ADH production at night. Research has found that these are similar in three-year-olds and teenagers. We can understand, therefore, that there is a strong correlation between the age of night dryness and the maturation of the child's circadian rhythm and ADH secretion.<br><br>Stool excretion<br><br>The intestines absorb nutrients and move any remaining waste through the body, first through the small intestine and then the large, so that it may be excreted.<br><br>The small intestine comprises the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In adults, it measures about twenty feet in length. Its primary functions are to absorb nutrients from food and to break it down, ready for excretion. Small fingerlike projections, known as villi, cover the inside of the small intestine and aid in the absorption of nutrients by increasing its surface area. The small intestine adds further enzymes to those that were introduced to the food in the stomach, so continuing the process of digestion, absorption, and breaking down, as food is moved along, toward the large intestine, via a series of muscle contractions known as peristalsis.<br><br>The large intestine is about five feet in length and comprises the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. The colon is a long muscular tube connecting the cecum (the first part of the large intestine) to the rectum (the last part). It is subdivided into the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon-the ascending being connected to the cecum and the sigmoid being connected to the rectum.<br><br>As food passes through the colon, salt and water are extracted, turning soft and liquid waste into solid matter consisting of food debris and bacteria. This remains in the sigmoid colon until it is emptied into the rectum, approximately twice every day, where it is stored temporarily until stretch receptors in the rectal wall sense fullness and send a message to the brain to excrete the waste (stool or poo) via the anal canal. Like urination, the process of defecation depends on the opening of two sphincters, one internal and one external, once again a mix of involuntary and voluntary control. The internal sphincter is opened when the intrarectal pressure is increased due to the presence of waste, which pushes the internal walls of the anal canal open slightly. But as with urination, it is the external sphincter that is under our conscious control, and it is this that children must learn to master when potty training. The external sphincter is opened by the muscles of the pelvic floor, which cause the anal canal to open fully and the rectum to temporarily shorten in order to expel stools. This conscious control-or lack of it-can lead to soiling, withholding, and constipation in children. Constipation occurs when stools remain in the rectum for too long and the solid waste is moved back into the colon, where further salt and water extraction occurs. This may then lead to a buildup of hard, compacted waste. (Soiling, withholding, and constipation are discussed at length in chapter 6.)<br><br>Understanding the physiological basis of bowel and bladder control provides us with many insights into potty training. When we consider bladder capacity, detrusor muscle development, hormonal changes, and the conscious control of the external sphincters, we can appreciate that potty training, both during the day and at night, is a developmental stage, just like learning to walk and talk. It is not one that can be rushed, at least not without difficulties. Similarly, trying to delay potty training when a child is physically and psychologically ready is foolish and somewhat naive. We wouldn�t try to prevent a child from walking if they had learned at a time that was inconvenient for us. Why then do so with potty training? The following chapter thus brings us naturally to the very important question: When is the right time to potty train?<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>When to Begin<br><br>W hen should you begin potty training? I would love to give you a definitive answer, but, sadly, real life is not so black-and-white. Children do not develop at exactly the same pace; there is no internal switch that clicks "on" at some magical date. Ultimately, there is only one way to decide when it is time to begin potty training, the decision being made by one person and one person only: your child.<br><br>Does this mean that you have no involvement in the timing of potty training? Not exactly. Your role is that of watcher and waiter. You watch for certain signs and behaviors, and you wait, being mindful of your child's age. This does not mean that you are doing nothing-indeed, it could be argued that you have already begun the process of potty training by being informed and carefully observing and watching for the right time. It is an active, purposeful wait, as summed up by the late American bishop Fulton John Sheen: "Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is 'timing,' it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way."<br><br>Having said that, whereas some parents do not wait long enough, some wait too long. You need to be prepared to begin as soon as your child is ready. Putting potty training off until a late age, perhaps because of certain events or inconveniences, is potentially as damaging as beginning potty training before the necessary physiological and psychological developments have taken place.<br><br>In this chapter we will look at the timing of the start of potty training, with an eye on both physiological development and the effects of emotions-yours and your child's. We will also look at some of the signs that may indicate a good time to start, as well as some that may send you in the wrong direction. Last, we will look at the potential pitfalls both of starting too early and too late.<br><br>Important physical changes to look for<br><br>As discussed in the previous chapter, there are a number of differences between adults and children when it comes to the excretory organs and their effect on continence. Let's do a quick recap of the most important points:<br><br>Detrusor muscle coordination: In chapter 1 we looked at the phenomenon of incomplete voiding in babies, which is thought to be due to a lack of coordination of the detrusor muscle and communication with the brain and bladder sphincters. This incoordination disappears by the time the child enters toddlerhood.<br><br>Control of the external sphincters: The act of passing pee and poo is both an involuntary and voluntary process (see page 4). The child will develop the ability to voluntarily open and close the external sphincters once the messages are sent correctly to and from the brain. This voluntary control is regulated by the child's central nervous system (CNS). The CNS develops while the child is still in utero and continues to mature after birth, as the brain makes new connections as the child grows.<br><br>An increase in bladder capacity: Bladder capacity grows quickly, tripling from birth to age two, after which it slows a little. At two years of age, the bladder's capacity is 200 ml, only 27 ml smaller than it will be at age four. The full adult capacity is around 455 ml. From this perspective, therefore, any time from two years onward is a good time to begin to potty train.<br><br>Maturation of circadian rhythm and secretion of ADH at night: Our body clock (circadian rhythm) controls processes in our bodies related to sleep and wakefulness. At night we secrete a hormone called ADH, which helps to reduce urination so that we may sleep uninterrupted. However, it takes until a child is around three years of age for this day/night pattern to mature. For this reason, night dryness is primarily a developmental, hormonal process that we can expect, on average, from around age three onward.<br><br>When looking at potty-training readiness from a purely physiological view, it is safe to say that we may expect a child to be dry in the daytime from two years onward and for night dryness to occur from three years onward. Of course, there will always be children who can attain voluntary dryness earlier, but this is definitely not the physiological norm. It is also possible to be "diaper-free" before this age, but it is important to understand that the dryness is superficial; while it is possible to catch pee and poo in a potty or encourage the baby to go to the potty using various conditioned cues (for instance, making certain noises), this is not true voluntary control. Does this mean that there is a problem if a child isn't out of diapers by three years of age? No, it doesn't. While the child may most likely (but not always) be physiologically able to control their body, emotionally it may be a very different story.</p><h2>Parenting Your Third Grader: A Guide to Making the Most of the &#34;Sounds Like Fun!&#34; Phase</h2><p><p><b>Parenting Your Third Grader</b></p><b> </b><p><b>MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY PHASE IN YOUR CHILD'S LIFE</b></p> <p>You have approximately 936 weeks from the time your child is born until he or she graduates from high school.

The questions flow directly out of the context of the chapters of this book. If you do not become familiar with the material, your discussion is likely to be stilted and artificial.</p><p>Follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. Don&#x2019;t feel like you have to answer each and every question. Because of the different dynamics of individuals and groups, some questions will spark intense discussion, while others will generate yawns. Pay attention to the levels of passion, volume, and interest in the group.</p><p>Maintain a balance between structure and spontaneity. It&#x2019;s important that the group choose a leader, preferably one who has gifts of leadership and discernment. The leader should take responsibility for guiding discussions, determining relevance, and making sure that everyone participates.</p><p>Practice openness to God and others. Don&#x2019;t just accept something because the book or someone in the group says that it&#x2019;s true. If you have a question, ask it&#x2014;no matter how "ignorant" or "unspiritual" you might think it will make you seem. If you have trouble formulating questions, ask short ones like "What do you mean by that?&#x2019; "Can you give an example?" or "I&#x2019;m troubled by that statement; could you please help me understand it?" Remember that the path to finding God often starts with a question.</p><p>Develop accountability. In addition to sharing in the group discussions you might want to consider establishing a relationship with a person within the group. This one-on-one relationship would be an opportunity to "tell your stories" and pray for each other in your continuing journey toward finding God. Introduction: Solving Problems Isn&#x2019;t the Point 1. Up to this point in your Christian experience, what has drawn you toward finding God? What hinders you from finding him? 2. Dr. Crabb states that in today&#x2019;s world we have shifted away from finding God toward finding ourselves. How have you seen this shift in yourself? your Christian community? How do you feel about this shift? 3. How does the shift from finding God to finding self affect you? 4. This introduction presents three options for dealing with our lives: (1) being completely absorbed in understanding how our souls have been wounded and how to be healed; (2) obeying God with a resolve that completely ignores our pain; or (3) a combination of sensitivity to our struggles with an insistence that God matters more than how we feel. Which of these has been the way you have mostly dealt with life? Explain. 5. Which of these three options would you choose to be the way you deal with life?

When you ask yourself why you are making them, Quindlen encourages you to give this answer: For me. &#x201c;Because they are what I want, or wish for. Because they reflect who and what I am. . . . That way lies dancing to the melodies spun out by your own heart.&#x201d;<br><br>At the core of this beautiful book lies the secret of authentic success, the inspiration to embrace your own uniqueness and live the life that is undeniably your own, rich in fulfillment and meaning.</p><p>ANNA QUINDLEN is the author of four novels&#x2013;Blessings, Black and Blue, One True Thing, Object Lessons&#x2013;and five nonfiction books: Loud and Clear, A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Living Out<i> </i>Loud, Thinking Out Loud,<i> </i>and How Reading Changed My Life. She has also written two children&#x2019;s books: The Tree That Came to Stay<i> </i>and<i> </i>Happily Ever After. Her <i>New York Times</i> column &#x201c;Public and Private&#x201d; won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. Her column now appears every other week in Newsweek.Adult/High School&#x2013;In this brief treatise, Quindlen attempts to deter readers from continually seeking perfection, which is by definition unoriginal and stereotypical. She believes that everyone needs to find her (or his, though the general tone and the illustrations seem to focus on female needs) own true self, especially for those moments when there is nothing else left. She describes herself as having been a true perfectionist throughout high school. After a semester or so at Barnard, she realized that she would never be the prettiest, smartest, or "est" anything, but she could try to find out who she was and not be afraid to try new and unusual routes through life. This realization was more freeing than she expected, and she encourages readers, young and older alike, to do the same. The book reads much like a commencement address, but both size and subject matter should appeal to teens looking out on the landscape of their lives. It is also a good example of an essay or short biographical account for those studying such literary forms.<i>&#x2013;Susan H.

It was an above-average bar, generic Irish, and it would have fit in fine in London or Chicago. Instead it occupied the ground floor of a low-rise building in downtown Manama, the capital of Bahrain, a small island in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>By eleven p.m., JJ&#x2019;s would be packed with men and women pressing their bodies together in search of pleasures great and small. Now, at nine, the bar was crowded enough to have a vibe, not too crowded to move. A skinny kid with bleached-blond hair spun Lady Gaga and Jay-Z from his iPod as a dozen women danced badly but enthusiastically. The crowd was mostly European expatriate workers, along with American sailors from the Fifth Fleet, which was headquartered in Bahrain.</p><p>Robby Duke had gotten to JJ&#x2019;s early. The best girls were taken by midnight. Robby was twenty-eight, built like a rugby player, squat and wide, with long blond hair and an easy smile. Plenty of girls liked him, and he liked plenty of girls. Expat birds were all more or less the same. British, European, whatever, they came to the Gulf for adventure, and adventure usually meant a few easy nights.</p><p>Dwight Gasser was Robby&#x2019;s wingman. He was soft-spoken, almost shy. He wasn&#x2019;t much use as a wingman, but some women liked his curly hair and sleepy eyes. &#x201c;Them two,&#x201d; he said, nudging Robby toward the corner. A blonde with a round face and nice thick lips. The other, skinnier and darker. Spanish maybe. They sat side by side, facing a table with two empty seats.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Your Highness.&#x201d; Robby squared up and headed for them. Once he&#x2019;d decided to go for it, he didn&#x2019;t see the sense in mucking about.</p><p>&#x201c;Room for two more?&#x201d;</p><p>The blonde sipped her drink and looked at him like a copper who&#x2019;d caught him pissing in an alley and wasn&#x2019;t sure whether to give him a ticket or wave him on.</p><p>&#x201c;All yours,&#x201d; she finally said.</p><p>Robby extended a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Robby Duke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Josephine.&#x201d;</p><p>They shook. Robby sat. Robby looked around for Dwight, but he&#x2019;d disappeared, as he sometimes did when an introduction didn&#x2019;t seem to be going well. Annoying bastard. Though he&#x2019;d be back soon enough, might even have a beer for Robby by way of apology.</p><p>&#x201c;Josephine. A fellow commoner. Where you from? If you don&#x2019;t mind my asking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;London.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The center of the universe.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d bet his right leg that she didn&#x2019;t live in London.</p><p>&#x201c;Slough, really.&#x201d;</p><p>Slough was a suburb west of London, just past Heathrow Airport. Slough was more like it, Robby thought. He could line Slough up and send it into the right corner, and the keeper wouldn&#x2019;t do anything but wave.</p><p>&#x201c;Slough sounds like London to a Manchester boy like me.&#x201d; He turned to the dark-haired girl. &#x201c;You from London, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome. The city of&#x2014;&#x201d; Robby couldn&#x2019;t remember what Rome was the city of. &#x201c;Anyhow, the plot thickens. What brings you ladies to JJ&#x2019;s?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re cabin crew,&#x201d; the Italian girl said. &#x201c;For Emirates&#x201d;&#x2014;the biggest airline in the Middle East, known for its shiny new planes and equally shiny flight attendants.</p><p>&#x201c;Emirates. Have you flown the A-three-eighty, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beast,&#x201d; Josephine said. &#x201c;Who thought a plane with eight hundred seats was a good idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not glamorous, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About as glamorous as the Tube.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; the Italian said. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s stupid, but still, there&#x2019;s something amazing about it. How something so big can fly.&#x201d;</p><p>Robby turned to face the Italian. She had a big nose, but she wasn&#x2019;t bad. Those dark eyes and that long black hair. And the accent. Most important, she looked happy to talk to him, unlike Josephine.&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, Italiano?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cinzia.&#x201d; Beside her, Josephine sighed. Have fun with Dwight, Robby almost said. You two will get along great. Instead, he raised his glass. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to Italy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To Italy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And to Bahrain on a Thursday night.&#x201d; He took a long swallow of his beer. <i>And we&#x2019;re off.</i></p><p><b>THE BLACK MERCEDES E190</b> rolled down the King Fahad Causeway, the ten-mile bridge between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Below the asphalt was the water of the Persian Gulf, warm as a bathtub and nearly as flat.</p><p>Omar al-Rashid sat behind the wheel. His younger brother, Fakir, slept beside him in the passenger seat. A line of drool curled into Fakir&#x2019;s pure white <i>thobe,</i> the long gown that Saudi men wore. Fakir had the soft bulk of a high school nose tackle. His <i>thobe</i> draped his round stomach like a pillowcase. He was eighteen, two years younger than Omar.</p><p>&#x201c;Fakir.&#x201d;</p><p>Fakir grunted irritably. &#x201c;Let me sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been asleep since the Eastern Province. And you&#x2019;re drooling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m relaxed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re as stupid as a donkey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better to be stupid than scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d; Omar punched Fakir, his fist thumping against Fakir&#x2019;s biceps. And then, wished he hadn&#x2019;t, for Fakir didn&#x2019;t complain, didn&#x2019;t even rub his arm.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, brother, if you want to back out. We can do it without you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d; For the first time in his life, Omar hated his brother. He was scared. Anyone would be scared. Anyone but a donkey like Fakir. But now he&#x2019;d gone too far. The humiliation of quitting outweighed the fear of death. And maybe the imams were right. Maybe virgins and endless treasures awaited them on the other end.</p><p>Though he didn&#x2019;t see the imams lining up to find out.</p><p>Three minutes later they reached the tiny barrier island that marked the border of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. A bored guard checked the Mercedes&#x2019;s registration. A hundred meters on, an immigration agent swiped their passports and waved them through without asking their plans. Everyone knew why Saudis went to Bahrain. They went for a drink, or two, or ten. They went to hang out with their girlfriends without being hassled by the <i>muttawa,</i> the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. The Saudi religious police. They went to watch movies in public, movie theaters being another pleasure forbidden in the Kingdom.</p><p>After Bahraini immigration, they were waved into a shed for a customs inspection. An officer nodded toward the blue travel bag in the backseat. &#x201c;Open it, please.&#x201d; Omar unzipped the bag, revealing jeans, boots, and black T-shirts. The clothes were hardly suspicious. Saudi men often changed into Western-style clothes in Bahrain. &#x201c;Enjoy your visit,&#x201d; the officer said, and waved them on.</p><p>&#x201c;We will,&#x201d; Fakir said.</p><p><b>AT JJ&#x2019;s, ROBBY WAS</b> off his game. Dwight had won Cinzia&#x2019;s attention, leaving Robby with Josephine. He decided to go the tried-and-true route of getting her drunk.</p><p>&#x201c;Time for another round. What&#x2019;s your pleasure?&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine raised her glass, still half full. &#x201c;No thanks, Frodo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Frodo!&#x201d; Robby said, in what he hoped sounded like mock horror. In reality the joke cut a bit close. &#x201c;Hope I&#x2019;m bigger than he is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope so, too. For your sake.&#x201d; She glanced at Cinzia.</p><p>&#x201c;Figuring the odds you&#x2019;ll be stuck with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; She swallowed the rest of her drink. &#x201c;All right, then. Vodka and tonic. Grey Goose.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Of course, Grey Goose,</i> Robbie thought. <i>Top-shelf all the way, this one. And thin odds I&#x2019;ll get more than a peck on the cheek.</i> &#x201c;One Grey Goose and tonic coming up.&#x201d;</p><p>Five minutes later, he was back with fresh glasses. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My pleasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about you? Live here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; Even this one would melt a bit when she heard his next line. &#x201c;I teach.&#x201d; Robby grinned. &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. How could I teach? You probably think I barely made my O-levels&#x201d;&#x2014;the basic British high school graduation exams. &#x201c;But these kids are special.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Special how?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Autistic. Developmentally disabled, we call it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That must be hard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel lucky every day.&#x201d; Robby wasn&#x2019;t lying. He did feel lucky. Lucky he wasn&#x2019;t one of the monsters. Half of them spent their days spinning and screaming <i>whop-whop-whop</i> every ten seconds like they were getting paid to imitate helicopters. The other half punched you when you asked them to look you in the eyes like they were actual human beings. Once in a while, Robby felt he was getting through. Mostly he could have been playing video games in the corner for the good he did. Lucky, indeed.</p><p>&#x201c;My cousin&#x2019;s son, he&#x2019;s autistic.&#x201d; Josephine&#x2019;s mouth curled into a smile Robby couldn&#x2019;t read.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you close with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hah. Real little bugger, inn&#x2019;t he? Talk to him, he runs off and bangs his head against the wall. Pick him up, he claws at you like you&#x2019;re about to toss him out the window. Six months of his mum telling him, &#x2018;Pick up the spoon, Jimmy, pick up the spoon.&#x2019; And he picks up a bloody spoon. And we&#x2019;re supposed to pretend he&#x2019;s solved cancer or some such. But come on, the kid&#x2019;s basically a vegetable with arms and legs and a mouth for screaming. Pick up the spoon already and be done with it.&#x201d;</p><p>Robby was speechless. Of course, what she&#x2019;d said wasn&#x2019;t that different from what he&#x2019;d been thinking, but <i>you weren&#x2019;t supposed to say it.</i> It wasn&#x2019;t civilized.</p><p>&#x201c;I wish you could see the look on your face. Like I&#x2019;d suggested putting the darlings in the incinerator.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that what you think we should do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only if they misbehave.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;My. I&#x2019;ve shocked you again. I&#x2019;m pulling your leg, Robby. Honest to God, I don&#x2019;t have any idea what to do with them. Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re people. Could have been any of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine took another sip of her Grey Goose. &#x201c;Could have been, but it warn&#x2019;t. Why should we all run around and pretend that the facts of life aren&#x2019;t so?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe sometimes pretending is the only way to get by.&#x201d;</p><p><b>OMAR AND FAKIR HAD</b> grown up in Majmaah, a desert town in north-central Saudi Arabia. Omar&#x2019;s father, Faisal, was a big man who wore a red-and-white head scarf and kept his <i>thobe</i> short around his thick calves, the practice followed by conservative Muslims. He saw Omar and Fakir&#x2014;the youngest sons of his third wife&#x2014;only rarely.</p><p>By the time Omar reached puberty he understood that he was a spare, to be watered and fed in case his older brothers died. The knowledge hollowed his insides, but he never complained. His brother was simpler and happier than he. They were best friends, their strengths complementary. Omar helped Fakir with his lessons, and Fakir pulled Omar out of his doldrums.

However, before having faith in Jesus, I was angry at God and blamed Him for my lack of limbs and the fact He didn't seem to care. I thought He&#x2019;d forgotten me or wasn't real at all was because He didn't answer me when I asked with much faith for limbs miraculously. Neither did He answer me when I asked why He had done this. Because of being bullied at school, experiencing a lot of negative attention, feeling like I was a burden to my parents, and not seeing a right future, I attempted to commit suicide by drowning myself in a bath tub. As I was in the process, the thought of leaving my parents with much grief helped me to not go through with the suicide. It was by God's grace that I am still here, and I can hear the words ring true in Jeremiah 29: 11-14. </p> <p> <strong>What advice can you offer to other people who are mentally or physically disabled, and feel like their life is "over" and worthless?</strong> </p> <p> Any negative lies and thoughts that come in are not from God if the statements are not in-sync with the Word, the heart of God. Every day, we must pray that the Lord guards our hearts and minds as we battle with principalities and powers of darkness. We have the truth. Remind yourself of the truth of your identity, purpose and destiny in Christ. Put on the full armor of God. Ask God for the gift of faith to believe every loving word of the Bible and the discipline to have time in worship or prayer or reading of the Scriptures to further the growth of your faith. Take one day at a time. We all have a fear of being lonely. Some have been abandoned, but Jesus is with you. Trust Him, and if you don't know Him, seek Him. </p> <p> <strong>Describe an average day for Nick? How long it takes to get ready in the mornings? </strong> </p> <p> As a teenager, I wanted to prove to myself that I could be independent, and it would take me an hour to get ready, brush my teeth, go to the restroom, shower and dress myself. These days I like to focus on what gives me more joy and save my energy for the things that are truly rewarding after proving to myself that I could be independent. So, I have caregivers who take care of me and get me ready especially when traveling. </p> <p> <strong>How did you meet your wife?</strong> </p> <p> My wife Kanae and I fell in love at the top of a Bell Tower in McKinney, Texas at the "Adriatica.&#x201d; The fully story is in my book, but it was at a night where I only spoke to 16 people, and we watched the Butterfly Circus. I shared about the ministry's goals and heart in reaching the world. Fireworks were in our minds and hearts when our eyes connected that night... and for the rest of the story, get the book. </p> <p> <strong>What qualities or characteristics attracted you to her? Do you plan to have children soon?</strong> </p> <p> She is my best friend, and I adore her. She has unimaginable grace, love, patience and meekness. She is such a focused and gentle giver. We are hoping to have children in a few years, but you never know what the Lord wants. </p> <p> <strong>Where do you live/attend church?</strong> </p> <p> With living in Southern California but traveling quite a lot over the years, it has been difficult to find a home church that we truly see our children growing up in long term. But we genuinely enjoy the fellowship of the Apostolic Christian Church in Pasadena and love their hearts in valuing the family-style congregation. </p> <p> <strong>You minister around the world to children, churches and businessmen. What message is on your heart at the moment?</strong> </p> <p> In such a world and generation, there is so much information and entertainment and vicious pressure to be someone you're not yet or to get something you don't have yet. The message to preach is the truth. To know our true worth, knowing that we are all loved, and we are here for a greater purpose. </p> <p> <strong>Tell us about your book - what inspired you to write it, what do you hope it will achieve, who is it for?</strong> </p> <p> Before writing <em>Unstoppable</em>, I personally went through two major life-changing experiences that I learnt so much in and through. I went through a personal crisis in December 2010. Then I met my wife and started courting her at the end of 2010. That's why I wrote <em>Unstoppable</em>. I love how God lets us go through difficult challenges to help each other and encourage one another. That's what family is for. I also speak, write, sing on YouTube "Something More" and act in the short film "Butterfly Circus." I want to communicate a message of hope and love that continues to evolve as I walk closer to Jesus. </p><b>Nick Vujicic</b>&nbsp;is a motivational speaker and the director of the nonprofit organization, Life Without Limbs.

Here are some of his most inspired and deeply original recipes, dishes that are radiant not just in color but in flavor, and filled with alluring hints of international influences. Chutneys, pestos, and flavored vinaigrettes take the place of heavier and more traditional French fare, and the juxtaposition of ingredients (watermelon with ricotta salata; roasted carrots with oranges and avocado; raw baby turnips and juicy pears) adds energy to a once hidebound bistro tradition.

At 20, after putting himself through cooking school, Marchand began a journey that would take him to London, Hong Kong, Spain, and New York. While cooking at Jamie Oliver&#x2019;s Fifteen, he earned the nickname Frenchie, an appellation that stuck.

Born in the mountain stronghold of Sheikh Abu Ishak, the colt shows great promise. During a band of robbers&#x2019; attempt to steal him, the colt escapes and learns to survive on his own in the high mountains. Will he ever find his way home?</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Steve Farley</b> is the son of Walter Farley, the man who created the Black Stallion and wrote 20 stories about the best-loved literary horse of all time. A freelance writer based in Manhattan, Steve travels frequently, especially to places where he can enjoy riding, diving, and surfing.In a high, grassy pasture, well concealed in the remote mountains of eastern Arabia, two herders tended their horses.<br><br> "It is a dying breed," the old herder said in a deep, guttural voice. "Our chieftain knows this as well as I do. His only hope rests with the black one." He waved his gnarled hands in the direction of the small band of young horses grazing in the light of the setting sun.<br><br> The young herder, tall and thin, lowered his body to sit on the ground beside the old man. His kufiyya, a white headdress made of fine cloth, was drawn back, revealing a look of childish eagerness and anticipation on his face. He had heard this talk many times before. Still, he asked his questions and listened eagerly for the old one's replies.<br><br> "O Great Father," he said, "thou who knowest everything, is it not true that our leader is the richest of all sheikhs in the Rub' al Khali? Is it not his wealth that enables him to breed and maintain horses of such power and dazzling beauty as we see before us? Look at them, Great Father. Their coats have the gleam of raw silk and although they are still young, little more than a year old, their shoulders are muscular and their chests deep. Truly they are horses of inexhaustible strength, endurance and spirit, all worthy of the great tribe of Abu Ja Kub ben Ishak."<br><br> "It is true our leader is one of great wealth, but that does not make him the wisest breeder of all," the old man proclaimed, his small, sharp eyes never leaving the horses. Reaching for his walking stick, he tried to get his old legs beneath him. After a brief struggle, he gave a weary sigh and sank down again.<br><br> The young man drew back before the harshness of the ancient one's words. He wanted no confrontation. His only recourse was to humor the old man. Slowly, a soft smile came to his hard, flat face.<br><br> "O Great Father, I do not mean any disrespect," he said, waving his long, powerful arms in the cold mountain air. "I know there is no other horseman as wise as you, who have spent your long life in the same saddle as your forefathers. It is only my bewilderment at your words. We are living with the birds of the mountaintops when our feet as well as those of our horses prefer the soft, hot sands of the desert. Why are we here if not to breed and raise the fastest horses in all the Rub' al Khali?"<br><br> The wind blew in great gusts. Despite a glaring sun, the day had been icy cold. Winter seemed unwilling to leave the highlands, where the barren peaks of gray limestone were now painted blue and yellow by the softening light. Setting his turbaned head against the wind, the young man waited for the old man's answer. Receiving no reply and growing impatient, he persisted. "Tell me, Great Father, pray tell me, what other reason would we have for coming to this mountain stronghold of our leader?"<br><br> Finally, the old man turned his head toward the youth, his bones showing prominently beneath taut, aged skin. To the young man he appeared to be a hundred years old or more, his body frail and withered beneath the folds of his great aba, a shapeless black cloak. How could such an old man stand this cold, coming as he did from the gleaming sands of Arabia, where the burning desert scorched the soles of one's feet?<br><br> No one in their tribe knew how many years it had been since the old man had first traveled the paths from the desert to the Kharj district of the high eastern mountains in order to serve the forebears of Abu Ja Kub ben Ishak. There was no other horseman like him in all Arabia. He was the oldest and wisest--yet he kept traveling back and forth, tending each crop of young horses, searching for what? What dream led him on and on over such tortuous trails? The young man wanted to know. It had to do with horses, of that he was certain. Horses were the ancient one's life. Their blood was his blood, his blood theirs. It was the only thing that had kept him alive.<br><br> Others might scoff at the old herder's crazy stories and his wild talk about a stallion of the night sky, but the young man felt privileged to share his watch with the legendary one. He had learned a great deal over the winter and hoped someday to breed horses himself. For now he would help the old man back and forth from their tents in the valley up to the different pastures, a job that was becoming more and more difficult as the old herder weakened with age.<br><br> The blasts grew colder still, and the young man drew his wool-lined garment closer about him. His black, gleaming eyes remained on the old man while he waited for him to speak. The silence continued except for the sound of the wind blowing from the mountaintops. Out in the pasture the yearlings continued to feast on the first green shoots of spring grass. Soon it would be time to find fresh grazing, and they would move elsewhere.<br><br> At last the young herder decided to break the silence again. His tone was good natured and soft as he said, "The Prophet is with you always, Great Father, but I do not understand when you say that our mounts are a dying breed. Abu Ishak would have your head, old and wise as it is, for proclaiming such a thing, if only to me. Rest your mind, Great Father, I will never repeat what you have said. But, pray, tell me about the horses we see beyond. You have seen their like many times before?"<br><br> The old man's piercing eyes were clear and untroubled. His thin shoulders heaved beneath his cloak, as if he were gathering breath. From somewhere he found the strength to speak, if only in a loud whisper.</p><h2>The Bold and Brilliant Garden</h2><p>Want to create a dramatic garden that leaves a lasting impression? This stunning guide offers a new approach to planning and planting, encouraging you to throw caution to the wind and orchestrate colours, textures, scale and scent to spectacular effect from spring until autumn. The key is colour: intense, strong and voluptuous such as deep crimsons combined with acid green and incandescent orange. Integral to the vision is a feeling for dramatic scale: plants with huge presence, architectural foliage, strong, sculptural shapes and to complete the effect, flowers with silken and velvety textures and flooding the garden with scent. There are schemes for sunny, open beds and borders for shady areas, for damp soils and to clothe walls and fences - many of which include lots of quick-growing annuals and take only a season to achieve. This is the go-to guide for achieving a spectacular and striking garden.</p><p><p>Sarah Raven, writer, cook, broadcaster and teacher, is an expert on all things to grow, cut and eat from your garden.

His professional career began at the University of Illinois where he assisted in research centered around toxicology, pharmacokinetics (the study of how drugs are metabolized and utilized by the body) and antibiotic resistance transference between people and animals while simultaneously attending veterinary college.<br><br>After finishing college he practiced general veterinary medicine, examining and treating both farm animals and pets for one year before deciding to limit his practice to dogs and cats only. It was then that he opened his own practice, which grew rapidly, allowing him to bring additional veterinarians into the practice. Eventually he purchased a second practice and built a new state of the art facility, which included a grooming salon and pet boutique on the grounds of the original pet hospital. Those practices have since been sold to allow Dr. Harrell to pursue other interests. <br><br>While still in private practice, Dr. Harrell became passionate about some pet products sold by Oxyfresh, because he had observed positive results in his patients while using these products. That led to him working in Oxyfresh booths at both veterinary and grooming conferences. At one of those events he met Sheryl Spangler. She had years of experience in the corporate world and was just then transitioning into the world of dog grooming as both a groomer and grooming school owner.&nbsp; <br><br>Time and shared philosophies soon led Dr. Harrell and Sheryl to become business partners. Eventually they would form Pet Pros Business Coaching, LLC, a company that offers consulting services to both the grooming and veterinary profession. Both Dr. Harrell and Sheryl are certified business coaches and human behavior specialists, helping people to understand themselves; how others tend to perceive them; and how personalities affect team building, performance and harmony in the workplace.<br><br>They each are seasoned international speakers on topics of business principles and people behaviors/management. They have addressed pet professional and veterinary audiences, small business owners (of all types) and their peers in business coaching and veterinary consulting events.&nbsp; <br><br>Because groomers have the opportunity to get to know pets and their owners, Dr. Harrell has recognized the importance of pet professionals as educators and first line promoters of responsible pet ownership and pet health maintenance. Out of a commitment to help ensure that they give sound pet health advise to their clients, he has become a regular contributor to Groomer to Groomer and Off Lead and Animal Behavior magazines on both pet health and business topics. Feedback from those articles written and presentations given was the impetus to make this book a reality.<br><br>Dr. Harrell continues to practice pet medicine and surgery while serving as Team Coordinator and Hospital Director of SPCA, Inc. in central Florida. He also continues as a pet consultant to Oxyfresh Worldwide and as a professional speaker, writer and consultant to the grooming, veterinary and small business communities.</p><h2>The Complete Aliens Omnibus: Volume Four (Music of the Spears, Berserker)</h2><p>MUSIC OF THE SPEARS&nbsp;<br>by Yvonne Navarro<br>New York City, 2124, and the streets are swarming with Alien Jelly addicts and homeless people.

In her latest body of work, collected in this new publication, Galembo turns to Mexico, where she captures cultural performances with a subterranean political edge. Using a direct, unaffected portrait style, Galembo captures her subjects informally posed but often strikingly attired in traditional or ritualistic dress. <br>Masking is a complex tradition in which the participants transcend the physical world and enter the spiritual realm. Masks, costumes and body paint transform the human body and encode a rich range of political, artistic, theatrical, social and religious meanings on the body. In her vibrant color photographs, Galembo highlights the artistry of the performers, how they use materials from their immediate environment to morph into a fantastical representation of themselves and an idealized vision of a mythical figure. In a gorgeous, fascinating photographic survey of Mexico&#x2019;s masking practices, Galembo captures her subjects suspended between past, present and future, with their religious, political and cultural affiliations&#x2015;their personal and collective identifications&#x2015;displayed on their bodies. <br>Photographer <b>Phyllis Galembo</b> (born 1952) received her MFA from the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison in 1977, and was Professor in the Fine Arts Department of SUNY Albany from 1978 to 2018. A 2014 Guggenheim Fellow, Galembo has photographs in numerous public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Public Library. Her photographs of ritual masks in Africa, the Diaspora and beyond have been the subject of several monographic publications, including <i>Maske</i> (Aperture, 2016).</p></p><p>Mexico: Masks | Rituals offers vivid portraits of people costumed as Easter Wise Men and shepherds, as jaguars and foxes and tigers, as demons, as skeleton women in elaborate gowns, as indigenous peoples resisting Spanish colonists.

Later on the country was told that the white people of Phillips County had risen against the Negroes who started this riot and had killed many of them, and that this orgy of bloodshed was not stopped until United States soldiers from camp Pike had been sent to the scene of the trouble. Columns were printed telling of an organization among Negro farmers in this little burg who were banded together or the purpose of killing all the white people, the organization being known as the Farmers' Household Union. As a result of these charges over one hundred Negro farmers and laborers, men and women, were arrested and jailed in Helena, Ark., the county seat of Phillips County. One month later they were indicted and tried for murder in the first degree and the jury found them guilty after six minutes of deliberation. Twelve were sentenced to die in the electric chair&#x2014;six on December 27th and six on January 2nd, and seventy-five of them were sent to the penitentiary on sentences ranging from five to twenty-one years! Several national bodies among colored people, notably the Equal Rights League, sent letters of protest to Governor Brough, but press dispatches reported that the governor refused to interfere, because he believed the men had received justice. Thereupon, the Chicago branch of the Equal Rights League sent telegrams to Senators Medill McCormick and Curtis, chairman on committee on race riots and Congressman Martin B. Madden asking the federal government to take some on to protect these men and see that they got justice.</p><p></p><h2>The Secrets of the Federal Reserve -- The London Connection</h2><p>From the Foreword. In 1949, while I was visiting Ezra Pound who was a political prisoner at St. Elizabeth&#39;s Hospital, Washington, D.C. (a Federal institution for the insane), Dr. Pound asked me if I had ever heard of the Federal Reserve System. I replied that I had not, as of the age of 25. He then showed me a ten dollar bill marked &#34;Federal Reserve Note&#34; and asked me if I would do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve System which had issued this bill. Pound was unable to go to the Library himself, as he was being held without trial as a political prisoner by the United States government. After he was denied broadcasting time in the U.S., Dr. Pound broadcast from Italy in an effort to persuade people of the United States not to enter World War II. Franklin D. Roosevelt had personally ordered Pound&#39;s indictment, spurred by the demands of his three personal assistants, Harry Dexter White, Lauchlin Currie, and Alger Hiss, all connected with Communist espionage.</p><p></p><h2>Space Cat and the Kittens</h2><p>"Paul Galdone's pictures, especially of the kittens in their space suits, have humor and imagination to match the text." &#x2014; <i>Saturday Review</i><br> Flyball, the famous Space Cat, is a father now!

Playing with both meanings of the word 'phenomenal,' Blaise depicts dark skies dotted with stars, swirling currents, riotous flowers, and creatures from microorganisms to elephants&#x2014;a vibrant visual world shared with ethnically and culturally diverse humans. Gentle whimsy prevails: a bewigged avian playing a harp illustrates an aspect of birdsong that&#x2019;s similar to human music, while two people shyly sitting far apart are yet connected by their 'microbial clouds.' Addressing such wide-ranging topics as the Big Bang, plant neurotransmitters, insect husbandry, hidden water footprints, and 'mitochondrial Eve,' Blaise encourages a sense of wonder at the phenomenal world. 'Even in an office with no windows,' she writes, 'every breath we take contains trillions of air molecules that cycle through the world and connect us with life on Earth.'

At least they are the heirs of what Minogue describes as "the triumph of an enlarged, flexible, and pragmatic version of liberalism."</p> <p>But what, precisely, is liberalism? Or, more accurately, can liberalism be defined precisely? Minogue attempts to answer both questions. "<i>The Liberal Mind</i> attempts to uncover the philosophy of liberalism and lay bare its implications. What is Man? How does he think and feel? What is the place of Reason in human affairs? How should men live? What is politics, and what is it <i>for</i>? These are the questions which liberalism both asks and answers. The answers supply a technique of living, which is a utilitarian moral guide: yet the great advantage claimed for this code is that it is scientific. Because of this claim, liberalism is forced into a series of moral and political evasions, both doctrines and emotional habits of thought. These are dissected in <i>The Liberal Mind.</i>"</p> <p>The past two centuries have been characterized, in the West at least, by "the fury of old ideological battles . . . such as: A planned economy, or free enterprise? Individual thrift, or social services? Free trade, or protection?" These battles have largely been completed&#x2014;and, many would say, have been won by the champions of, respectively, free enterprise, individual thrift, and free trade.</p> <p>By examining the larger implications of the concept of liberalism, Minogue offers fresh perspective on the political currents that continue to shape governments and policy in the Western world.</p> <p><b>Kenneth Minogue</b> is Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the University of London.</p></p><p>Kenneth Minogue is emeritus professor of political science at the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London.

Without trusting others, we cannot function in society, or even stay alive for very long, but being overly trustful can leave us open to exploitation and abuse. And not only is trust pragmatic, but it also has a moral dimension: trustworthiness is a virtue, and well-placed trust benefits us all. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, philosopher Katherine Hawley explores the key ideas about trust and distrust. Drawing on a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, and evolutionary biology, she emphasizes the nature and importance of trusting and being trusted, from our intimate bonds with significant others to our relationship with the state. Considering questions such as "Why do we value trust?" and "Why do we want to be trusted rather than distrusted?" Hawley illuminates the importance of trust in the personal and public spheres. Moreover, she draws on a range of research to show how trust stands at the center of many disciplines, including biology, psychology, and game theory. The book also examines the evolutionary aspects of trust.<br></p><p><br><strong>Katherine Hawley</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews and Head of the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies.

Regional specialties, such as Hog Snapper Pepe (from the Boca Raton branch) and Baltimore Crab Cakes, are also included. <br>In addition to the vast selection of main dishes, there are appetizers (Spicy Crab Cakes, Smoky Mackerel Spread, Mussels au Gratin), salads (Shrimp Tabbouleh, Crabmeat and Mango Salad, Lobster and Israeli Couscous Salad), pasta and rice dishes (Linguine with Littlenecks; Salmon with Asparagus and Ravioli; Risotto with Shrimp, Celery, and Peppers), soups and sandwiches (Shellfish Gumbo, Fish Chowder, Grilled Swordfish Tacos), vegetables and side dishes (Speckled Butter Bean Casserole, Onion Strings, Chipotle Sweet Potato Mash), and desserts (Key Lime Pie, Blueberry and Peach Crumble, Mango and Strawberry Shortcake). <br><i>The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook</i> also provides an overview of the full range of fin fish and shellfish (from bass to wolffish, clams to squid) available today and the best cooking techniques for each type&#x2014;whether it is baking, broiling, frying, poaching, sauteing, grilling, oven-steaming, or microwaving&#x2014;as well as how to distinguish wild from farm-raised fish. There is complete advice on how to tell if fish is fresh, how to store it once you bring it home, how to prepare it, and how to make safe and delicious use of the leftovers. Much more than a cookbook, this is the ultimate sourcebook from America&#x2019;s seafood specialists.</p><p>&#x201c;Dreaming about the most joyous days of my life always brings me straight back to Boston.

It is filled with valuable information that is useful to everyone. The personal stories over decades provide you with practical information that can change your life. I highly recommend the book, and am sharing it with others." </i><br><br>"Much has been written about nutrition and juicing, so Dr. Saul decided to write something different: "This is what I did."

That pioneering work paved the way for the author&#x2019;s other distinguished books on nomenclature, including The Name Dictionary and Best Baby Names for Jewish Children. <p>Now, in this most comprehensive work ever prepared on the subject, Rabbi Kolatch expands on his previous efforts by introducing many hundreds of new Hebrew names that have become popular in both Israel and the diaspora. He thereby provides an indispensable resource for parents seeking a name for their newborns, for sociologists analyzing societal trends, and for scholars tracing the evolution of language. </p><p>The Comprehensive Dictionary of English &amp; Hebrew First Names begins with an introduction that explains the origins of names and the Jewish naming process. It discusses the Bible as a source of names, names with positive attributes, celebrity names, masculine/feminine interchanges, and more. Wide-ranging in scope, the dictionary also explains the ceremonies traditionally followed for naming a boy and a girl and explores Jewish custom as it relates to naming children after relatives, naming an adopted child, and naming a convert. </p><p>The entries in this book are presented alphabetically. Immediately following each entry, where applicable, the Hebrew spelling is provided in vocalized Hebrew script. The language(s) from which the name derives as well as its literal meaning are then indicated. Finally, Hebrew equivalents are offered in transliterated English. Those seeking to name a child based on meaning will find the exhaustive Index of Names by Meaning an invaluable tool.</p></p><p>Alfred J.

His elegant book consists of short musings on the relationship we have with the objects in our lives. As a maker of objects, he wonders out loud about the way our memories and senses relate to decisions about what we make and how we go about making choices in the studio and in our living material world.<br>The revised edition uses the same text, but packages it in a smaller and thicker volume. The new Syntax augments the text with pinhole camera images like the original edition, but this book includes more of them. This edition replaces the original (gold/red) book, which is now out of print.</p><p>Tim McCreight is a metalsmith and teacher who has been fascinated with the material world for as long as he can remember. As someone who has spent his adult life making things and helping others to work with their hands, he has an interesting perspective on our relationship with the objects in our lives. In this book he muses on his personal observations and in the process addresses universal sentiments.Over the years, Tim McCreight has built an excellent reputation as an author of instructional books for metalsmiths. These books are clearly and concisely written so even the most inexperienced novice can comprehend them. This is why we were pleasantly surprised to see Tim's latest offering, The Syntax of Objects, a departure from his usual fare, and, in our opinion, a book that rises to the level of fine literature, relating to a universal audience, not just metalsmiths. It is a quiet, reflective work that provides an introspective look at the way everyday objects stir our memories and emotions, thus influencing our lives.<br>Tim examines our relationships with objects, beginning with our earliest memories as infants through childhood, adulthood, and into our golden years. Most of these memories are nostalgic and universal no matter where and when we were born. He also differentiates between handmade objects have special significance because the craftsman fashions a part of himself into each of these objects, exposing his innermost thoughts and baring him to all who examine his creations. <br>This book is not technical, rather, it is about creativity and connections. Objects have the unique ability to create connections through time and space. We know little of ancient people except for the objects they left behind, but these relics speak volumes about their lives and loves, as well as their warfare. We, as artists, hope the objects we create in our lifetimes will be just as meaningful.<br>Tim explores the creative aspects of how we work, and how we often experience tunnel vision in crafting an object, we are aware only of our mind, hand, and the objects. Everything else just fades away in a blur until all our creative thoughts have transmogrified into the object. When we are finished, we often feel drained and exhausted as if we have incorporated a part of our soul into the object.<br>Objects communicate with us on many different levels we can see them, smell them, hear them, and touch them. We are completely surrounded and enveloped by a multitude of objects both in the physical world and in our memories. Objects we haven't seen or touched in 50 years can immediately evoke powerful memories and intense emotions. Memories are ghosts of the past that reside in the attics of our minds hiding among the cobwebs, awaiting only the slightest cue to flood back onto the center stage of our consciousness.<p>The Syntax of Objects is the perfect size to tuck in your pocket or a bag to take with you on a picnic or trip to the beach a perfect way to spend a reflective afternoon. Keep this book close at had as you'll want to revisit it often like an old friend or a fond memory. --Lapidary Journal<br><br>There are many sides to metalsmith Tim McCreight, and those of us who are lucky enough to have worked with him will gladly agree to disagree that it's his joyful, humorous, relaxed approach to living, or his mastery of tools and techniques, or his exuberant teaching style that has most influenced our lives and our art. Yet none would be surprised that the man who wrote the bible on metalsmithing fundamentals has released a quiet, contemplative book that ponders the significance of the simple objects that help us define ourselves. Sepia-toned pinhole photography underscores Tim's journal-esque reflections with mystery rather than nostalgia. Give your hands a rest and immerse yourself.

Estranging, broadening, darkening forms of children emerge as this book illuminates the child queered by innocence, the child queered by color, the child queered by Freud, the child queered by money, and the grown homosexual metaphorically seen as a child (or as an animal), alongside the gay child. What might the notion of a &#x201c;gay&#x201d; child do to conceptions of the child? How might it outline the pain, closets, emotional labors, sexual motives, and sideways movements that attend <i>all</i> children, however we deny it?<p></p><p>Engaging and challenging the work of sociologists, legal theorists, and historians, Stockton coins the term &#x201c;growing sideways&#x201d; to describe ways of growing that defy the usual sense of growing &#x201c;up&#x201d; in a linear trajectory toward full stature, marriage, reproduction, and the relinquishing of childish ways. Growing sideways is a mode of irregular growth involving odd lingerings, wayward paths, and fertile delays. Contending that children&#x2019;s queerness is rendered and explored best in fictional forms, including literature, film, and television, Stockton offers dazzling readings of works ranging from novels by Henry James, Radclyffe Hall, Virginia Woolf, Djuna Barnes, and Vladimir Nabokov to the movies <i>Guess Who&#x2019;s Coming to Dinner</i>, <i>The Hanging Garden</i>, <i>Heavenly Creatures</i>, <i>Hoop Dreams</i>, and the 2005 remake of <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>. The result is a fascinating look at children&#x2019;s masochism, their interactions with pedophiles and animals, their unfathomable, hazy motives (leading them at times into sex, seduction, delinquency, and murder), their interracial appetites, and their love of consumption and destruction through the alluring economy of candy.</p></p><p>"I don't know when I've been so captivated by a book and eager to get to the next page. That it is original and that it addresses a topic, the queer child, pretty much completely ignored is one mark of its importance. Even more striking though is the ease with which stunning insights are delivered as if they were a matter of course. Many readers will be struck by the centrality of Kathryn Bond Stockton's book and the graceful way it exposes and breaks the silence surrounding the queer child."--<b>James R. Kincaid</b>, author of <i>Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting</i> <p>"I consider Kathryn Bond Stockton to be one of the most impressive and important queer critics in the academy today, and <i>The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century</i> only confirms that assessment.

Even as Prohibition was the driving force behind organized crime, abortions became the third-largest illegal enterprise as state and federal statutes combined with changing social mores to drive abortionists into hiding. Inez Brown Burns, a notorious socialite and abortionist in San Francisco, made a fortune providing her services to desperate women throughout California. Beginning in the 1920s, Burns oversaw some 150,000 abortions until her trial and conviction brought her downfall.<br><br> In <i>San Francisco&#x2019;s Queen of Vice</i>,&nbsp;Lisa Riggin&nbsp;tells the story of the rise and fall of San Francisco&#x2019;s &#x201c;abortion queen&#x201d; and explores the rivalry between Burns and&nbsp;the city&#x2019;s newly elected district attorney, Edmund G. &#x201c;Pat&#x201d; Brown (father of the present governor of California). Pledging&nbsp;to clean up the graft-ridden city, Brown exposed the hidden&nbsp;yet not-so-secret life of backroom deals, political payoffs, and corrupt city cops. Through the arrest, prosecution, and conviction&nbsp;of Burns, Brown used his success as a stepping-stone for his political rise to California&#x2019;s governor&#x2019;s mansion.<br><br> Featuring an array of larger-than-life characters, Riggin shows how Cold War domestic ideology and the national quest to return to a more traditional America quickly developed into a battle against internal decay.

Pekar's mother was a Zionist by way of politics, his father by way of faith, and he inevitably grew up a staunch supporter of Israel. But as he became attuned to the wider world, Pekar began to question his parents' most fundamental beliefs. </p><p>This book is the full account of that questioning. Over the course of a single day in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, Pekar and the illustrator JT Waldman wrestle with the mythologies passed down to them, weaving a personal and historical odyssey of uncommon wit and power. With an epilogue written by Joyce Brabner, <i>Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me</i> is an es-<br>sential book for fans of Harvey Pekar and anyone interested in the past and future of the Jewish state.</p></p><p><b>Harvey Pekar</b> is best known for his graphic autobiography, <i>American Splendor</i>, which was based on his long-running comic-book series and was adapted into a film of the same name. He died in 2010. <b>JT Waldman</b> is an artist, interactive designer, and comic-book creator. He is the author and illustrator of the graphic novel <i>Megillat Esther</i>.

This is why biblical worship is always the response of the redeemed to God's initiative of self-revelation. <br> <br>If we worship according to our own imaginations and traditions, we will worship (at least to some degree) a God of our own imagination. <b>But when we worship according to God's own instruction, we worship the God who is - the only true God.</b></p><p><b>Terry Johnson</b> is the senior minister of the Independent Presbyterian Church in Savannah, Georgia. His other books include <i>When Grace Comes Home</i>; <i>When Grace Transforms</i>; <i>When Grace Comes Alive</i> and the best-selling <i>The Family Worship Book</i>."For John Calvin, it was the issue of worship that necessitated the Reformation. Terry Johnson concurs, and in this book he applies biblical principles to reform contemporary worship. In this volume Johnson argues a cogent biblical case for worship according to the historic understanding of the regulative principle. His treatment of John Frame's contributions in the area of worship is important reading for those encouraged by contemporary style worship.

The tales are narrated by one Kolenkorov, who is anything but a model Soviet author: not only is he still attached to the era of the old regime, he is also, quite simply, not a very good writer. Shaped by Zoshchenko&#x2019;'s masterful hand--s&#x2014;he takes credit for editing the tales in a series of comic prefaces&#x2014;--Kolenkorov&#x2019;'s prose is beautifully mangled, full of stylistic infelicities, overloaded flights of metaphor, tortured clich�, and misused bureaucratese, in the tradition of Gogol.<br><br>Yet beneath Kolenkorov&#x2019;'s intrusive narration and sublime blathering, the stories are genuinely moving. They tell tales of unrequited love and amorous misadventures among down-on-their-luck musicians, provincial damsels, aspiring poets, and liberal aristocrats hopelessly out of place in the new Russia, against a backdrop of overcrowded apartments, scheming, and daydreaming. Zoshchenko&#x2019;'s deadpan style and sly ventriloquy mask a biting critique of Soviet life&#x2014;and perhaps life in general<i>. </i>An original perspective on Soviet society in the 1920s and simply uproariously funny, <i>Sentimental Tales</i> at last shows Anglophone readers why Zoshchenko is considered among the greatest humorists of the Soviet era<b>.</b></p><p>Mikhail Zoshchenko (1894&#x2013;-1958) was a leading Soviet satirist. His stories of the 1920s made him enormously popular with readers. In 1946 he was expelled from the Soviet Writers&#x2019; Union. He never recovered from this trauma and died of heart failure in 1958.<br><br>Boris Dralyuk is the editor of <i>1917: Stories and Poems from the Russian Revolution</i> (2016) and coeditor of <i>The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry </i>(2015).The only thing harder than cracking jokes may be translating them. Perhaps this is why Mikhail Zoshchenko remains a lesser-known Russian writer among English-language readers, despite being one of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s most beloved humorists, a satirist in the best traditions of Gogol. Boris Dralyuk&#x2019;s new translation of <i>Sentimental Tales</i>, a collection of Zoshchenko&#x2019;s stories from the 1920s, is a delight that brings the author&#x2019;s wit to life (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>A book that would make Gogol guffaw. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>If you find Chekhov a bit tame and want a more bite to your fiction, then you need a dose of Zoshchenko, the premier Russian satirist of the twentieth century. . . .

Countercultural.<br><br>Does standing out in the crowd ever leave you speechless?<br><br>Like in St. Paul s day, the church around the world and particularly in America now frequently faces hostility at the first mention of homosexuality in casual conversations or public square debates.<br><br>Author Matthew Rueger openly embraces this hot topic, giving you a framework for defending your beliefs by first exploring the relationship between sexual sin in ancient history and twenty-first century tangles of the same flavor. Topics such as temptation, promiscuity, marriage, homosexuality, natural law, and the church s role in it all swirl together to reveal our unifying need for a Savior. Rueger writes compassionately with a father s heart and adamantly with a fierce determination to outline the truth about sexual morality from a reasoned Christian perspective.<br><br>We need to expect the unpleasant from our opponents, arm ourselves with answers to common objections, and speak in clarity and love. And let s not lose sight of the church as a place of refuge for those who are battered down by their desires. Real people with real struggles are being lost.<br><br>Find your voice!</p><p>Rev. Dr. Matthew W. Rueger is pastor of St. John Lutheran Church in Hubbard, IA.We live in a world where traditional views on sexuality and marriage are collapsing. How do we stand up for a Christian position when it is rejected simply because it is Christian? Dr. Rueger uses Scriptures and early Christianity to show that we are not alone, nor is there anything new under the sun. His discussions are thoughtful and clear, compassionate and Christ-centered. Biblical sexual morality will always be countercultural. This book is a helpful, welcome apologetic. --Deaconess Sandra Rhein, Hymnal Consultant, LCMS Office of International Missions, Deaconess, Emmaus Lutheran Church, South Bend, IN<br><br>In an age of compromise, it is refreshing to read a work that takes a firm stand on a controversial topic. This book is both faithful to Scripture and pastoral in its approach. Although the sin of homosexuality is clearly described as contrary to God s will, the presentation of the Gospel was applied clearly and powerfully in a way that should bring comfort and hope to the repentant. I pray that it will be widely read. It will offer clarity to many who want to believe the truth but don t always know how to defend it. --Rev. Daniel Preus, DD, Third Vice President, The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, President of the Luther Academy Board of Directors<br><br>Matthew Rueger reminds us that wider social opposition to Christian sexual morality is no recent, contemporary development. Christians have been mocked and sanctioned to varying degrees for their opposition to social sex practices since the first century. Their courage encourages us today to remain resolute with Scriptural testimony even when we might be mocked or sanctioned not for the sake of culture wars or condemnation of others, but to continue to set forth the new life in Christ. Rueger calls for steadfastness in the face of increasing social opposition while offering deeply-reasoned pastoral insights to serve repentance from immorality, reconciliation with God, and healing in the Spirit. --Rev.

Challenging the traditional view that the British are natural &#39;sons of the waves&#39;, he suggests instead that the country&#39;s fortunes as a significant maritime force have always been bound up with its economic growth. In doing so, he contributes significantly to the centuries-long debate between &#39;continental&#39; and &#39;maritime&#39; schools of strategy over Britain&#39;s policy in times of war. Setting British naval history within a framework of national, international, economic, political and strategic considerations, he offers a fresh approach to one of the central questions in British history.</p><p><b>Paul Kennedy</b> is among the world's best-selling and most influential historians. Raised in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he took his doctorate in Oxford and began work shortly afterwards for the first great historian of WW2, Sir Basil Liddell Hart. He now teaches at Yale, and is the author or editor of nineteen books, including <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i> (translated into over twenty languages), and <i>Engineers of Victory: The Problem Solvers Who Turned the Tide in the Second World War</i>."The best single-volume study of Britain and her naval past now available to us." &#x2014;Jon Sumida, <i>Journal of Modern History</i><br><br><br>"As soon as it appeared in 1976, Paul M. Kennedy's magisterial survey of the historical role and significance of British seapower was recognized by serious naval historians as a work of first importance. . . . This is by far the most important survey of British Naval history since Sir Herbert Richmond's <i>Statesmen and Sea Power</i> (1946), and in some ways it is more important . . . the whole book displays an immense historiographical grasp of a calibre that broad surveys seldom attain. The author's unfailing powers of discernment are further revealed by a sparkling and apt quotation on practically every page." &#x2014;Daniel A.

But in 1946 he finds himself in the Royal Air Force, facing a stretch in military prison . . . when along comes Lt Colonel Burne-Jones to tell him MI6 has better use for his talents.<br><br>Posted to occupied Berlin, interrogating ex-Nazis, and burgling the odd apartment for MI6, Wilderness finds himself with time on his hands and the devil making work. He falls in with Frank, a US Army captain, with Eddie, a British artilleryman and with Yuri, a major in the NKVD and together they lift the black market scam to a new level.

In the midst of it all is the Giant, O'Brien, a freak of nature, a man of song and story who trusts in myths, fairies, miracles, and little people. He has come from Ireland to exhibit his size for money. O'Brien's opposite is a man of science, the famed anatomist John Hunter, who lusts after the Giant's corpse as a medical curiosity, a boon to the advancement of scientific knowledge.</p><p>In her acclaimed novel, two-time Man Booker Prize winning author Hilary Mantel tells of the fated convergence of Ireland and England. As belief wrestles knowledge and science wrestles song, so <i>The Giant, O'Brien</i> calls to us from a fork in the road as a tale of time, and a timeless tale.</p></p><p>Like Andrew Miller (<i>Ingenious Pain</i>, <i>Casanova in Love</i>) and Penelope Fitzgerald (<i>The Blue Flower</i>), Hilary Mantel turns to the 18th century in order to make a universal point. Her eighth novel, <i>The Giant, O'Brien</i>, takes place during that bifurcation of mind and spirit known as the Age of Reason. The year is 1782 and Charles O'Brien has fled Ireland, bringing both his massive frame and his ancient folk tales to England, where he hopes to make his fortune as a sideshow exhibit. "His appetite was great, as befitted him; he could eat a granary, he could drink a barrel. But now that all Ireland is coming down to ruin together, how will giants thrive? He had made a living by going about and being a pleasant visitor who fetched not just the gift of his giant presence but also stories and songs ... many hearths had welcomed him as a prodigy, a conversationalist, an illustration from nature's book. Nature's book is little read now, and he thought this: I had better make a living in the obvious way. I will make a living from being tall." <p> Unfortunately, O'Brien's height attracts more attention than he might like: John Hunter, a surgeon, becomes fascinated with the giant and obsessed with the possibility of dissecting him after he's dead. Thus Mantel sets up the central conflict of her novel: Hunter's thirst for knowledge and fame versus O'Brien's conviction that without his body his soul cannot go to heaven. In the mean streets of 18th-century London, the author explores the division of soul and body, imagination and rationalism, as she juxtaposes the two men's lives. In this collision of cultures and points of view, she offers no easy answers, but instead turns a disturbing spotlight on questions that continue to resonate to the present day. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The year is 1782; the place, London: centre of science and commerce, home to the newly rich and magnet to the desperately poor-among whom is the Giant, O'Brien, a freak of nature.

When the richest dude in town can&#x2019;t sleep, he hires a much-less-rich dude named Johann Gottlieb Goldberg to play him lullabies on the harpsichord. Goldberg does an OK job, but as the Rich Dude hollers for Goldberg each night, he wakes up the whole town in the process. As the town gets sleepier and sleepier and grumpier and grumpier, Goldberg worries he may be out of a job soon. But then, the one and only Bach enters the scene with a series of lullabies composed specifically for the Rich Dude. And, thus, the Goldberg Variations are born!

Bach&#39;s &#34;Goldberg Variations,&#34; loosely based on Albert Schweitzer&#39;s account which may or may not be true. A young musician named Goldberg is hired to lull a wealthy man to sleep but night after night, his usual lullabies don&#39;t work. In fact, his boss says they are too boring. Fortunately, the greatest composer of all time, Bach, shows up when the rich man is at his most tired and grumpy. Taking pieces of an old folk song, a dance-hall tune, and other &#34;leftover notes,&#34; Bach combines them to compose what is later known as the &#34;Goldberg Variations.&#34; As strange and difficult as the music seems (&#34;Like being in a thunderstorm of notes!&#34; declares one listener), it is just what is needed for the rich man to get the sleep he needs. The irreverent Angleberger paired with illustrator Elio is a winning combination. Comic style, primary colors, and bold lines offer a whimsical invitation into classical music (links for listening and downloadable sheet music are provided) and its brain-enhancing effects.

Though associated with the persecution of heretics and Jews - and with burning at the stake - its targets were more numerous and its techniques more ambitious. The Inquisition pioneered surveillance, censorship, and &#34;scientific&#34; interrogation. As time went on, its methods and mindset spread far beyond the Church to become tools of secular persecution. Traveling from freshly opened Vatican archives to the detention camps of Guantanamo to the filing cabinets of the Third Reich, the acclaimed writer Cullen Murphy traces the Inquisition and its legacy, showing that not only did its offices survive into the twentieth century, but in the modern world its spirit is more influential than ever. With the combination of vivid immediacy and learned analysis that characterized his acclaimed Are We Rome? , Murphy puts a human face on a familiar but little-known piece of our past and argues that only by understanding the Inquisition can we hope to explain the making of the present.</p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Cullen Murphy</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q: Why the Inquisition&#x2014;and why now? </strong> </p><p><strong> A:</strong> This question gets to the very heart of the book. We&#x2019;ve all heard of the Inquisition&#x2014;and we all remember the Monty Python line, "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition"&#x2014;but we tend to think of it as something safely confined to the past, something "medieval" that in an enlightened age we&#x2019;ve moved far beyond. But that&#x2019;s exactly the wrong way to think about the Inquisition. Rather than some throwback, it&#x2019;s really one of the first &#x201c;modern&#x201d; institutions. This attempt by the Catholic Church to deal with its enemies, inside and outside, made use of tools that hadn&#x2019;t really existed before, tools that have only improved and that are part of our lives today.</p> <br><strong>Q: Like what? </strong><br> <p><strong>A:</strong> Well, let&#x2019;s start with what an inquisition is: it&#x2019;s a disciplinary effort designed to enforce a particular point of view, and it&#x2019;s built in such a way that it can last for a long time&#x2014;in this case, for centuries. To last for a long time you need to have some sort of functioning bureaucracy. You need to have trained people&#x2014;"technocrats," we might call them today&#x2014;who can run the machinery, and you need to be able to keep training new people. You need to be able to watch and keep track of individuals, know what they think, collect and store information, and then be able to put your hands on the information when you need it&#x2014;you need what today we&#x2019;d call search engines. And you need to be able to exert control over ideas you don&#x2019;t like&#x2014;in a word, censorship. It&#x2019;s quite a feat of organization. We take these kinds of capabilities for granted today. With the Inquisition, you can watch them being invented.</p> <p><strong>Q: Go back to the beginning and fill us in&#x2014;when did the Inquisition start, and why?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Over a period of about seven hundred years, there were many Inquisitions mounted under Church auspices, and they varied in intensity from era to era and place to place. That said, you can divide the Inquisition into three basic phases. The first of them, called the Medieval Inquisition, is usually given a starting date of 1231, when the pope issued certain founding decrees. It was mainly concerned with Christian heretics, especially in southern France, whom the Church saw as a growing threat. Then, in the late fifteenth century, came the Spanish Inquisition. It was run by clerics but effectively controlled by the Spanish crown, not by the pope, and its main targets were Jews and to a lesser extent Muslims. After that, in the mid-sixteenth century, came the Roman Inquisition, which was run from the Vatican, and was mainly concerned with Protestants. This is a very simplified outline. And all kinds of people were caught up in the Inquisition&#x2019;s machinery&#x2014;Jews and heretics, yes, but also witches, homosexuals, rationalists, and intellectuals. </p> <p><strong>Q: How did the Inquisition work? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In the early days inquisitors would arrive in a particular locale and ask people to come forward to confess their misdeeds or to point the finger at others. Because there was a "sell by" date&#x2014;anyone who came forward by a certain time would be treated with lenience&#x2014;a dynamic of denunciation was set into motion. Interrogation was at the center of the inquisitorial process&#x2014;hence the Inquisition&#x2019;s name. The accused was not told the charges against him or the names of the witnesses. The questioning often made use of torture. Detailed records were kept. Most of those who came before tribunals received sentences short of death&#x2014;for instance, they had to wear a special penitential gown for a year or two. But tens of thousands were burned at the stake for their beliefs. In all, hundreds of thousands of people passed through the tribunal process. The psychological imprint on society would have been profound. And as time went on, the Inquisition in some places became a fixture, with its own buildings and with officials in permanent residence. In some places, the networks of informers were complex and dense. </p> <p><strong>Q: Burning at the stake frankly doesn&#x2019;t seem all that contemporary. Why do you say that the Inquisition is essentially "modern"? </strong></p> <p><strong> A:</strong> I&#x2019;ll start by asking a different question: why was there suddenly an Inquisition when there hadn&#x2019;t been one before? After all, intolerance, hatred, and suspicion of the "other," often based on religious and ethnic differences, had always been with us. Throughout history, these realities had led to persecution and violence. But the ability to sustain a persecution&#x2014;to give it staying power by giving it an institutional life&#x2014;did not appear until the Middle Ages. Until then, the tools to stoke and manage those omnipresent embers of hatred did not exist. Once these capabilities do exist, inquisitions become a fact of life. They are not confined to religion; they are political as well&#x2014;just look at the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century. Or, on a far lesser scale, the anti-communist witch hunts. The targets can be large or small. An inquisition impulse can quietly take root in the very systems of government and civil society that order our lives.</p> <p> Let&#x2019;s think about those tools&#x2014;the ability to put people under surveillance; to compile records and databases, to conduct systematic interrogations, to bend the law to your needs, to lodge your activities in the hands of a self- perpetuating bureaucracy, and to underpin all this with an ideology of moral certainty. The modern world has advanced far beyond the medieval one on all these fronts. Look at what governments can do when it comes to listening in on private conversations, or what corporations can do to distill personal information from the Internet, or what law enforcement can do on a hint of a suspicion.</p> <p><strong>Q: In the wake of 9/11, torture has certainly made a comeback.</strong> </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it has, and it has done so for the same reason it always does: when the stakes seem very high, and when the people who want to do the torturing believe fervently that their larger cause has the full weight of morality on its side, then all other considerations are irrelevant. If you&#x2019;re absolutely certain that your cause is blessed by God or history, and that it&#x2019;s under mortal threat, then in some minds torture becomes easy to justify. The Inquisition tried to put limits on torture, but the limits were always pushed. Thus, if the rules said you could torture only once, you could get around that obstacle by defining a second session of torture as a "continuance" of the first session. </p> <p>That&#x2019;s how it is with torture&#x2014;once it&#x2019;s deemed permissible in some special situation, the bounds of permissibility keep being stretched. There&#x2019;s always some desired piece of information just beyond reach, and there&#x2019;s always the hope that one more little turn of the screw will secure it. The Bush administration pushed the limits not only in practice but also in theory. In its view, an act wasn&#x2019;t torture unless it caused organ failure, permanent impairment, or death. Ironically, that&#x2019;s a far narrower definition than what the Inquisition would have accepted. The Inquisition understood that torture began well short of that threshold&#x2014;and if it was reached, it had to stop. </p> <p></p>&#x201c;The Inquisition is a dark mark in the history of the Catholic Church. But it was not the first inquisition nor the last, as Cullen Murphy shows in this far-ranging, informed, and (dare one say?) witty account of its reach down to our own time, in worldly affairs more than ecclesiastical ones.&#x201d; &#x2014; Margaret O&#x2019;Brien Steinfels, former editor, <i>Commonweal</i><br><br>The Inquisition conducted its last execution in 1826 &#x2014; the victim was a Spanish schoolmaster convicted of heresy.

In this revised edition, Jonathan Wilson focuses more directly on lessons for these communities from Alasdair MacIntyre&#39;s After Virtue. In the midst of the unsettling cultural shifts from modernity to postmodernity, a new monastic movement is arising that strives to be a faithful witness to the gospel. These new monastic communities seek to participate in Christ&#39;s life in the world and bear witness by learning to live intentionally as the church in Western culture. This movement is about finding the church&#39;s center in Christ in the midst of a fragmented world, overcoming the failure of the Enlightenment project and our complicity with it, resisting the temptation to Nietzschean power, and building communities of disciples. This new edition is greatly enlarged from the original volume. It includes responses to critics of the new monasticism such as D. A. Carson, an entirely new chapter on the Nietzschean temptation, an afterword on properly understanding the new monastic movement, the dangers it faces, and the work yet to be done, as well as an appendix on the supposed post-modern agenda of Jonathan Wilson and Brian McLaren. For those striving to understand the path the church should take in this fragmented world, this book is essential reading.</p><p>Jonathan R.

He is also the literary executor of Mickey Spillane.Indefatigable genre veteran Collins brought back his hit-man hero Quarry two years ago (The Last Quarry, 2006) after a 30-year hiatus. Now he flashes way back to reveal how Quarry got in the killing business. Naturally, it started in Vietnam, where ne&#x2019;er-do-well Quarry found something he was good at&#x2014;killing people; later, after a wrong turn or two back in the States, he hooks up with a broker who runs a murder-for-hire business. Quarry&#x2019;s first target: a philandering college professor whose latest conquest happens to be the coed daughter of a Chicago mafioso. Rationalizing that the prof is a dead man whether or not Quarry does the deed, our antihero takes the job. Like Lawrence Block in his hit-man series starring the similarly one-named Keller, Collins manages the neat trick of engendering sympathy for a killer by muddying the moral waters: plot complications change the terms of the deal, requiring Quarry to do his killing out of self-preservation rather than cold-blooded commerce. Either way, Collins knows the terrain, mixing pulp-style action with just enough character building to keep us going.

Aided by his mother, he reads voraciously: "All of Swift, all of Sterne, <i>Invisible Man</i>, Baldwin, Joyce, Balzac, Auden, Roethke," along with a generous helping of philosophy, semiotics, and trashy thrillers. He's also fond of writing poems and stories (in crayon). But Ralph has limits. He's mute by choice and can't drive, so in his own estimation he's not a genius. Unfortunately for him, everyone else disagrees. His psychiatrist kidnaps him for testing, and once his brilliance is quantified (IQ: 475), a Pentagon officer also abducts him. Diabolically funny and lacerating in its critique of poststructuralism, <i>Glyph</i> has the feverish plot of a thriller and the philosophical depth of a text by Roland Barthes. If anyone can map the wilds of literary theory, it's Ralph, one of Percival Everett's most enduring creations.</p></p><p>With this wildly inventive new novel, Percival Everett has created his unlikeliest hero to date. Mute by choice, and able to read complex philosophical treatises and compose passable short stories while still in the crib, baby Ralph does not consider himself a genius-- because he is unable to drive. Plenty of others, however, want a stake in this precocious child prodigy. Among the most fiendish are Dr. Steimmel, the psychiatrist to whom his bewildered parents first take him, and her assistant Boris; Dr. Davis and her illegal chimps; and not-so-sweet Nanna, the secret agent. All have plans for Ralph, and no one wants to share the poor infant who misses his mother and does not take kindly to his new role as &#34;Defense Stealth Operative.&#34; Throughout the ensuing nation-wide chase of which he is the center, Ralph ponders on the theories of literary form-- and comes to some surprising conclusions of his own that perhaps only a baby could dream up.A narrative to question narrative, a highly original analysis of analysis, Everett&#39;s tour de farce prompts one to acknowledge that his is the true genius.[Image]Pictured above, Percival and his mule, Thelonious Monk.Percival Everett is the author of 12 other books, including &#34;Watershed,&#34; &#34;Frenzy,&#34; and&#34; Big Picture,&#34; He teaches at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.Praise for "Glyph" <br>Carol Muske-Dukes ""Glyph" is an answer-- and an antidote-- to not only what ails the Academy, but what ails a society without the self-knowledge to satirize itself. Percival Everett's infant genius protagonist vaults out of the playpen like Voltaire in flaming diapers-- to dispatch Theory's charlatans, kidnappers and con men in this brilliantly, wildly parodic romp.

After a sustained drought of trinitarian engagement, the doctrine of the Trinity has increasingly resurged to the forefront of Evangelical confession. The second half of the twentieth century, however, saw a different kind of trinitarian theology developing, giving way to what has commonly been referred to as the &#x201c;social Trinity.&#x201d;</p><p>Social&#x2015;or better, relational&#x2015;trinitarianism has garnered a steady reaction from those holding to a classical doctrine of the Trinity, prompting a more careful and thorough re-reading of sources and bringing about not only a much more coherent view of early trinitarian development but also a strong critique of relational trinitarian offerings. Yet confusion remains. As Evangelicals get better at articulating the doctrine of the Trinity, and as the current and next generation of believers in various Christian traditions seek to be more trinitarian, the way forward for trinitarian theology has to choose between the relational and classical model, both being legitimate options.</p><p>In this volume, leading contributors&#x2015;one evangelical and one mainline/catholic representing each view&#x2015;establish their models and approaches to the doctrine of the Trinity, each highlighting the strengths of his view in order to argue how it best reflects the orthodox perspective.

Focusing on the years between 1910 and 1940, when Chicago's black population quintupled, Chatelain describes how Chicago's black social scientists, urban reformers, journalists and activists formulated a vulnerable image of urban black girlhood that needed protecting. She argues that the construction and meaning of black girlhood shifted in response to major economic, social, and cultural changes and crises, and that it reflected parents' and community leaders' anxieties about urbanization and its meaning for racial progress. Girls shouldered much of the burden of black aspiration, as adults often scrutinized their choices and behavior, and their well-being symbolized the community's moral health. Yet these adults were not alone in thinking about the Great Migration, as girls expressed their views as well. Referencing girls' letters and interviews, Chatelain uses their powerful stories of hope, anticipation and disappointment to highlight their feelings and thoughts, and in so doing, she helps restore the experiences of an understudied population to the Great Migration's complex narrative.</p><p>Marcia Chatelain is Associate Professor of History at Georgetown University.&#x201c;This engaging read deftly examines the experiences of African American girls and young women as they undertook the vast emotional and physical paradigm shifts of the Great Migration era, with a specific geographical focus on migrants to the South Side of Chicago. . . .

Spanning the mid-1800s through the early decades of the 20th century, this book offers a visual account of early life in San Francisco, from family outings at Golden Gate Park, to the images of San Franciscans rebuilding their city after the devastating Earthquake and Fire of 1906.

He then considers the implications of authentic gnosis for cosmology, a question that connects intimately with his earlier studies, notably his ground-breaking work regarding the interpretation of quantum theory. The same considerations, however, which invalidate &#x201c;na�ve&#x201d; cosmology, have bearing on the theological notion of creatio ex nihilo as well; it is this crucial recognition that leads the author to consider alternative formulations within the Judeo-Christian tradition: from Christian Kabbalah to Jacob Boehme and Meister Eckhart.

During this period he gained recognition for his pioneering papers on the effect of diffusion fields, which provided a theoretical solution to the so-called re-entry problem for space flight. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, Dr. Smith pursued a professorial career in that field. Soon however his center of interest shifted from the pursuit of science to the critique of scientism and the rediscovery of metaphysics as a theological discipline. He has authored six books and numerous articles, and is today widely recognized as a leading authority in these twin fields.</p></p><p></p><h2>La Belle France: A Short History</h2><p><p>"A useful and charming introduction to a nation that has oh-so-definitely helped make the modern world what it is...

This is a captivating, beautifully illustrated, and comprehensive yet concise history of France.<br><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Alistair Horne is the author of eighteen previous books, including <i>A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954&#x2014;1962</i>, <i>The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916</i>, <i>How Far from Austerlitz?: Napoleon 1805&#x2014;1815</i> and the official biography of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. He is a fellow at St. Anthony&#x2019;s College, Oxford, and lives in Oxfordshire. He was awarded the French L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur in 1993 and received a knighthood in 2003 for his work on French history.When Occupied Vichy&#x2019;s Admiral Darlan was assassinated by a young French zealot in Algiers in December 1942, Winston Churchill observed to the House of Commons&#x2014;in exasperation moderated with great sympathy&#x2014;that the &#x201c;Good Lord in his infinite wisdom did not choose to make Frenchmen in the image of the English.&#x201d; Some, on both sides of the Channel, may shout &#x201c;Bravo!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hear Hear!&#x201d; but the fact is incontrovertible. With even less likelihood of challenge, the same could be said of the two nations. Geography, as much as history, though hand in hand, is what creates a nation. Over the centuries, while England lay protected from the invader (often, indeed, from outside influence) by the Channel, the North Sea and the Atlantic, France had nothing to guard her from the &#x201c;barbarian at the gates.&#x201d; As Guderian and Rommel proved in May 1940, not even her great but sleepy rivers like the Meuse, the Oise, the Somme and the Marne could prevent an invader from sweeping across the boundless flat plains of northern France to threaten her capital city, Paris&#x2014;any more than the Vistula and the Niemen could preserve Poland, with a geography that was so similar. (And see what a deal history dealt to the Poles!) West of the Rhine, all through her history, France had no topographical boundaries on which she could rely.<br><br>Thus much of her first two millennia encompasses an eternal hunt for security, on the one hand through strengthening herself at home; on the other, by aggressively pursuing expansionism abroad&#x2014;often under the slogan of la gloire. In the pursuit of security, opposing instincts of the libertarian versus the authoritarian would repeatedly vie against each other.<br><br>In the beginning, France consisted of little more than an embattled island in the middle of the River Seine, surrounded by bristling palisades, in what is now Paris&#x2019;s �le de la Cit�. The Romans founded<br><br>&#x201c;Lutetia,&#x201d; as they called it, at a time when, as readers of Asterix know, Gaul was divided into three parts under Julius Caesar. (The word &#x201c;Lutetia,&#x201d; romantic as it sounds, in fact derived from the Latin for &#x201c;mud&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;appropriately enough, as its long-suffering denizens would discover over many successive centuries.)<br><br>Fortunately, Emperor Julian (ad 358) found Lutetia, with its vineyards, figs and gentle climate, so thoroughly agreeable that he refused a summons to lead legions to the Middle East. Surprisingly, he even found the Seine &#x201c;pleasant to drink, for it is very pure and agreeable to the eye.&#x201d; Already in Roman times Lutetia became prosperous and alluring enough for it to be worth assault, and burning, by marauders from across the Rhine. About the same time as Nero watched Rome burn, the whole of the wooden settlements on the left bank were razed by fire. The city contracted, the Parisians withdrawing, once again, into the highly defensible fastness of the �le de la Cit�. One of the first of many Germanic invasions was seen off by Emperor Julian, after the Alamanni had come to within only twenty-five leagues away&#x2014;roughly the same spot as their grey-clad kinsmen reached under the Kaiser in 1914. The prayers of Sainte Genevi�ve, patron saint of Paris, reputedly caused Attila the Hun to swing away from the city in 451, and over the ages intercessions to her were to be made to save Paris from latter-day Huns&#x2014;with varying degrees of success.<br><br>Rome gave Paris her first revolutionary martyr, Saint Denis, decapitated at what became the &#x201c;Mons Martyrum&#x201d;&#x2014;or Montmartre. The fields around his place of execution were said to have &#x201c;displayed a wonderful fertility.&#x201d; Ever after, the Roman tradition would run like a vital chord all through French history, summoned up and referred back to at crucial moments. In his godlike splendour, the &#x201c;Roi Soleil&#x201d; tapped into it, content to see himself portrayed as Hercules on the Porte Saint-Martin. The Great Revolution and its heirs reinvented such artefacts as consuls and senators, tribunes and togas. Napoleon I had himself crowned Emperor, then emulated Trajan&#x2019;s Column to vaunt his victories over his foes at Austerlitz in the Place Vend�me; Napoleon III, also assuming the title of Emperor, reverently clad the statue of his great uncle atop it in a toga, and when things were going badly for him in 1869, went to seek inspiration at the Roman ruins of Lutetia.<br><br>Equally, the Seine was, and is, and always will be, Paris. From earliest days the navigable river and the north-south axis that intersected it at the �le de la Cit� formed one of Europe&#x2019;s most important crossroads. The island itself constituted a natural fortress, all but unassailable. In marked contrast to the estuarial, shallow and narrow Thames, the Seine&#x2019;s waters were not too swift and were capable of carrying heavy loads, ideal for commerce in wine, wheat and timber. It enabled Paris to dominate trade in the north as Lyons on the Rh�ne did in the centre, and Bordeaux on the Garonne and Nantes on the Loire in the west&#x2014;thus making Paris a natural commercial capital early in the Middle Ages; never to lose this primacy. Resting on the river like a great ship, Paris appropriately adopted the motto of Fluctuat Nec Mergitur (&#x201c;She Floats But Does Not Sink&#x201d;), retaining it as city burst far beyond its island bounds.<br><br>A dynasty of Frankish rulers, mostly yobbish louts whose name appropriately derived from the Latin word for &#x201c;ferocious,&#x201d; now pushed in from the east and devastated the Gaul lands as they went. Once established in France, having moved to Paris from the temporary capital of Rheims they came to be known as the Merovingians.* Over two-and-a-half dark centuries they wrangled and split among themselves, beginning with the first Merovingian king, Clovis, who killed off most of his family; &#x201c;after each murder,&#x201d; writes Maurice Druon, with some acidity: &#x201c;Clovis built a church.&#x201d; They were not gentle, or nice people, these Frankish forebears of the modern-day Parisian&#x2014;especially the women, who were strong, dominating, often ferocious, and who lived to great ages. There was Queen Fredegonda (545&#x2013;97), described as glowing &#x201c;like the eye of a nocturnal carnivore,&#x201d; who had women burned alive on flimsy allegations of being responsible for the deaths of her children, and for whose fierce pleasures her lover, King Chilperic, had his first two wives murdered within the same week. Even after Fredegonda&#x2019;s death, her bitter rival, Brunhilda (543&#x2013;613), now a venerable septuagenarian, was brutally put to death. Tortured for three days, her last descendants slain before her eyes, chroniclers have it that she was then hoisted onto a camel (possibly a somewhat rare spectacle in contemporary France) and paraded in front of her deriding army. Finally she was &#x201c;tied, by one arm, one leg and her white hair, to the tail of an unbroken horse,&#x201d; allegedly along what is now the Rue des Petits-Champs, stronghold of bankers in the 2nd arrondissement.<br><br>During the ascendancy of these formidable early Frenchwomen, precursors of Reine Margot and Madame Defarge, convents were burned to the ground with their inmates inside, leaders assassinated in conjugal beds, children abducted and murdered, hands severed, eyes gouged, lovers defenestrated, and cunning poisons developed in the name of statecraft. Byzantium had nothing more deplorable to show than the Merovingians. But at least, under Clovis, the notion of Paris as a capital city first became accepted, from which&#x2014;in the brief three last years of his grisly life&#x2014;Clovis administered a kingdom even larger than modern France. His descendant, Dagobert, died of dysentery, aged only thirty-six, but his interment at Saint-Denis established the principle for the burial of subsequent kings of France. In a curiously progressive fashion, none of the Merovingian rulers was ever crowned, they were all elected.<br><br>The throne of France would have fallen into Muslim hands if, a hundred years later, the usurping strong-man and bastard, Charles Martel, had not halted the Saracens at Poitiers. As it was, the closing years of the century saw the last of the Merovingians and the arrival of Charlemagne, a rather less attractive character than his portraits and subsequent canonisation would suggest. He was more German than French (and looked it), and an absentee ruler who did little for France, or Paris; it has mystified many that a statue was erected to him in front of Notre-Dame. It was more for his greatness than his goodness: crowned Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas day in the year 800, Charlemagne fought forty-seven campaigns in as many years; he married four times (he divorced his first wife, and then three died&#x2014;to be replaced by four concubines). He forbade his daughters to marry, preferring them to live at home and populate the court with bastards. Charlemagne&#x2019;s Carolingian dynasty would last another 200 years. His empire extended from the Pyrenees to the Elbe&#x2014;but he ran it all from Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), rather than Paris.<br><br>The great empire was short-lived. Under Charlemagne&#x2019;s son, the first of eighteen named Louis (nicknamed &#x201c;the Pious&#x201d;), it was dismembered into seven parts. As the Carolingians wrangled, and all Europe sank into a kind of lethargy, in the ninth century a new and unknown warrior race emerged to the north&#x2014;Norsemen, surging out of Scandinavia to invade the British Isles and Russia as far as Kiev, and even reaching Constantinople. In 843, Nantes was sacked, the bishop killed on the steps of his altar. Only two years later, 120 long-boats, terrifyingly decorated and with thirty pairs of oars, attacked Paris unexpectedly from up-stream. Once again the population fled; the Norsemen departed, carrying off tons of booty&#x2014;including the magnificent bronze roof of Saint-Germain-le-Dor�. They appeared everywhere, like some terrible plague of locusts, even sailing up the Rh�ne to pillage Valence, and striking at Pisa in Italy. Defenceless Paris was sacked&#x2014;and more churches lost their roofs&#x2014;another five times over the next twenty years. How these dauntless seaborne marauders were able to strike, with such impunity and effect, so far inland remains something of a mystery. Meanwhile the useless Charles the Bald occupied himself by putting out the eyes of his son, suspected of plotting against him.<br><br>As in the time of Attila, Paris shrank back into the original twenty-five acres of the �le de la Cit�. In 885, with Charlemagne&#x2019;s legacy disintegrating and the throne of France to all intents vacant, there came the first siege of Paris. Setting forth from England, a force of Norsemen captured Rouen and headed on up the Seine. Fourteen hundred boats, said to have &#x201c;covered two leagues of the river&#x201d; and bearing a formidable force of some 30,000 hirsute warriors, reached Paris. To have woken up and seen this terrifying array on the Seine must have been shattering for the Parisians. These Norsemen constituted a besieging force comparable only to the Prussians who were to invest the city almost exactly a thousand years later.<br><br>Led by a heroic Comte de Paris, Eudes, son of Robert the Strong, Paris refused to surrender&#x2014;the first time that any city had resisted the terrible Norsemen. Eudes was to prove himself France&#x2019;s homme fort, but the siege lasted ten grim months. Natural forces even allied themselves with the attackers; on 6 February a flood swept away the Petit Pont, enabling the Norsemen to capture one of the ch�telet fortresses. Next famine broke out. In despair, Eudes slipped out of the city and galloped to Germany to demand assistance from the Emperor, Charles the Fat. Charles set out unwillingly, but the size of his ponderous army moving down from Montmartre caused the fatigued Norsemen to hesitate. Dubious negotiations were entered into, in which the Parisians bribed the Norsemen with 700 livres of silver and a free passage of the Seine, both ways&#x2014;encouraging them to carry the war upstream to Burgundy, and leave Paris in peace. It was a deal which, subjecting the unhappy Burgundians to the worst winter they had ever known, would lead to centuries of instinctive mistrust and hatred between the principality of Burgundy and France, culminating during the Hundred Years War in an alliance with the English.<br><br>As a result of his brave defiance towards the Norsemen, two years later Count Eudes found himself elected as king by the nobles in preference to a German princeling: just to pile chaos on chaos, for a while there were in fact two Kings of France of East and West&#x2014;but in Paris<br><br>it was Eudes who mattered. In 911, he bought off the Norsemen by giving them the duchy of Normandy. From then on their eyes were encouraged to turn northwards, with cheerful projects of conquering Saxon England.<br><br>Now a great-nephew of Eudes, Hugues Capet, saw off the Germanic Emperor Otto II on the slopes of Montmartre (close to where Saint Denis was separated from his head). In 987, in the city of Senlis, he was elected king by assembled French barons, and a month later Capet was crowned in Rheims Cathedral, thereby establishing a fresh precedent, like Dagobert&#x2019;s interment at Saint-Denis. He ruled for only nine years (987&#x2013;96), but for the first time Paris had a French, not Frankish, king and a new French dynasty. Forced to give up title to Lorraine and concede the already historic fortress of Verdun to the Germans, however, the domain of France inherited by Hugues Capet looked like a tiny kernel surrounded by a mass of hostile pulp comprising Burgundy, Flanders, Normandy, Aquitaine and Lorraine. As the energetic Norsemen, now Normans, swarmed across the English Channel and began to reorganise the sleepy and backward Saxon England they had conquered, Capetian France remained poor, its vassals powerful, its rulers in thrall to the Church and inhibited by the lack of a common language. But by 1328, when the Capetian dynasty had run its course, the kingdom of France had become the most united and potent in western Europe.*<br><br>There are no portraits of Hugues Capet (although the surname came as a sobriquet because of the abbeys whose &#x201c;cappa&#x201d; he wore). He died young of smallpox, but he had arranged a dynastic marriage for his eldest son, Robert, and assured his succession as rex designatus. The only text attributed to him was his coronation oath:<br><br>I, who am about to become king of the Franks, by divine favour, on this day of my coronation, in the presence of God and the saints, . . . promise to distribute justice to the people who are in my care, according to their rights.<br><br>It was to be repeated by all his successors down to the revolution. Although he seems to have been a timid and anomalous character, herein lies Hugues Capet&#x2019;s claim to fame; from him would be descended nearly forty kings who would succeed each other over a period of more than 800 years.</p><h2>Haydn&#39;s Farewell Symphony (Once Upon a Masterpiece)</h2><p>Anna Harwell Celenza's engaging fictionalized telling of the story behind Franz Joseph Haydn's famous symphony is a perfect introduction to classical music and its power. THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY brings to life a long summer spent at Esterh�za, the summer palace of Prince Nicholas of Esterh�zy.<br><br>The blustering, bellowing prince entertained hundreds of guests at his rural retreat and demanded music for every occasion. As the months passed, Haydn was kept very busy writing and performing music for parties, balls, dinners, and even walks in the gardens. His orchestra members became homesick and missed their families. The anger, frustration, and longing of the musicians is expressed beautifully in the symphony born of the clever mind of Joseph Haydn who used it to convince Prince Nicholas that it was time to go home.<br><br>Wonderfully expressive illustrations by JoAnn E. Kitchel capture all the comedy and pathos of this unique symphony. Beautifully interpretive motifs and borders convey the setting and emotion of the story mirroring the structure of the symphony with the repetitive use of sets of four. Making classical music and history come alive with color and character, THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY ensures a place for the arts in the hearts and minds of children.</p><p>Anna Harwell Celenza is a musicologist and the author of several books for adults and children regarding music history and the history of art. Her children&#x2019;s books include THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY, PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION, GERSHWIN'S RHAPSODY IN BLUE, and VIVALDI'S FOUR SEASONS. Anna lives in Baltimore, Maryland.&#x201c;Where are my trunks of clothes?&#x201d; bellowed Prince Nicholas. &#x201c;And my chess set and the silver candlesticks?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They are all on the wagons, sir,&#x201d; replied a weary servant.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Haydn!&#x201d; the prince shouted. &#x201c;Are the instruments packed? What about the musicians? Where are all the musicians?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They are saying farewell to their families, sir,&#x201d; Haydn replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, tell them to hurry up!&#x201d; barked the prince. &#x201c;I am ready to leave.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the scene at Prince Nicholas&#x2019;s winter estate in Eisenstadt, Austria, on a sunny March morning in 1772. The winter&#x2019;s snow had just started to melt, and Prince Nicholas was preparing for the annual move to his summer palace in the Hungarian countryside. The palace was called Esterh�za, and it was the prince&#x2019;s pride and joy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanying the prince were twenty-two musicians and the royal music director, Joseph Haydn. Haydn was an excellent composer, famous throughout Europe. He wrote music for Prince Nicholas, but that was not his only responsibility. He also made sure that the musicians practiced diligently and stayed out of trouble. Haydn was even in charge of repairing broken instruments.</p><h2>Heart Disease No More!</h2><p>Make Peace with Your Heart and Heal Yourself Less than one hundred years ago, heart disease was an extremely rare disease. Today it kills more people in the developed world than all other causes of death combined. Despite the vast amount of financial resources spent on finding a cure for heart disease, the current medical approaches remain mainly symptom-oriented and do not address the underlying causes. Even worse: There is overwhelming evidence to show that the treatment of heart disease or its presumed precursors, such as high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries and high cholesterol, does not only prevent a real cure but can easily lead to chronic heart failure. The patient's heart may still beat, but not strong enough to feel vital and alive. Without removing the underlying causes of heart disease and its precursors, there is little, if any, protection against it. Heart attacks can strike regardless whether you have had a coronary bypass done or stents placed inside your arteries. According to research, these procedures fail to prevent heart attacks or reduce mortality rates. Heart Disease No More, excerpted from the author's bestselling Timeless Secrets of Health &amp; Rejuvenation, puts the responsibility for healing where it belongs, that is, to the heart, mind and body of each individual. It provides you with the practical insights about how heart disease develops, what causes it and what you can do to prevent and reverse it for good, regardless of a possible genetic predisposition.</p><p>Mortiz is a health consultant and practitioner of Ayurvedic Medicine.</p><h2>Two Steps Forward: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Rosie Project</em> comes a story of taking chances and learning to love again as two people, one mourning her husband and the other recovering from divorce, cross paths on the centuries-old Camino pilgrimage from France to Spain. </p><p><em>&#x201c;The Chemin will change you.

The positivist psychologists have taught us that a child s soul is a tabula rasa, in which we will find only what other people will write there. Therefore society tries to indoctrinate us, in the good and bad senses of the word. Therefore, the human person is used to listening only to others, no longer pays attention to the inspirations of the heart, which come from the Spirit. It is a privilege of artists to have inspirations, but not exclusively. In the spiritual life everyone must be an artist and construct their own life under the guidance of the supreme Artist. As Saint Ignatius of Loyola said: It is not the richness of science which satisfies the soul, but feeling and tasting things from within. This Book deals with Prayer and Spiritual life, with the experience of Grace and Goodness, through discernment of evil and human passions in everyday experience. It is a beautiful and simple proposal to construct our spiritual life through Discernment and Prayer of the Heart</p><p>"There is no doubt in my mind that &#x160;pidl�k's work is the most comprehensive general resource for the study of Eastern spirituality available today in a Western language." - Fr.

Its author is a person who obviously spent years of prayerful attention to both traditions as well as to non-Christian traditions... I hope it may bring its readers a thirst for freedom and for broader horizons. It is an excellent text to recommend to pastors and teachers, especially those compiling reading lists for those others within the context of a regular liturgical life and participation in the mysteries of initiation, reconciliation and communion within the Body of Christ." - Mother Raphaela, Abbess of The Holy Myrrh bearers Monastery, Otego, NY<b>Tom�&#x161; &#x160;pidl�k</b> was born in Boskovice, now in the Czech Republic, in 1919.

Among others, he met with Alexander Dubcek, the former First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and Václav Havel, who became President of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic after the fall of the communist regime. His Sunday homilies in the Czech language have been translated and published in various languages including Polish, Romanian and Italian. 1955 marked the beginning of his university career as a professor of Patristic and Eastern Spiritual Theology at various universities in Rome as well as around the world. He was made Cardinal in 2003 and has become known as one of the greatest experts in the spirituality of Eastern Christianity today. As a prolific author, he has been equally acknowledged in the academic and international fields, and has been chosen Man of the Year, 1990 and the most admired person of the decade by the American Bibliographical Institute of Raleigh in North Carolina. He was also decorated with the medal of the Masaryk Order, one of the highest honors of the Czech State, by President Vaclav Havel.</p><h2>Mother of the Believers: A Novel of the Birth of Islam</h2><p>Deep in the heart of seventh-century Arabia, a new prophet named Muhammad has arisen. As his message of enlightenment sweeps through Arabia and unifies the warring tribes, his young wife Aisha recounts Muhammad's astonishing transformation from prophet to warrior to statesman. But just after the moment of her husband's greatest triumph -- the conquest of the holy city of Mecca -- Muhammad falls ill and dies in Aisha's arms. A young widow, Aisha finds herself at the center of the new Muslim empire and becomes by turns a teacher, political leader, and warrior. <br> <br> Written in beautiful prose and meticulously researched, <i>Mother of the Believer</i> is the story of an extraordinary woman who was destined to help usher Islam into the world.</p><p><b></b><p><b>1 Mecca -- AD 613</b></p><p>I was born in blood, and its terrible taint would follow me all my life.</p><p>My mother, Umm Ruman, cried out in agony as the contractions increased in severity. The midwife, a stout woman from the tribe of Bani Nawfal named Amal, leaned closer to examine the pregnant woman's abdomen. And then she saw it. The line of blood that was running down her patient's thigh.</p><p>Amal looked over to the young girl standing nervously to the side of the wooden birthing chair where her stepmother was struggling to bring forth life.</p><p>"Asma," she said in a soft voice, trying to mask the fear that was growing in her chest. "Get your father."</p><p>Your mother, Abdallah, was no more than ten years old at the time, and she paled at Amal's words. Asma knew what they meant. So did Umm Ruman.</p><p>"I am dying," Umm Ruman gasped, her teeth grinding against the pain. She had known something was wrong the moment her water broke. It had been dark and mottled with blood, and the subsequent horror of the contractions was far beyond anything she had experienced at the birth of her son, Abdal Kaaba, so many years before.</p><p>At the age of thirty-eight, she had known that she was too old to bear another child safely and had greeted the news of her pregnancy with trepidation. In the Days of Ignorance before the Revelation, perhaps she would have turned to Amal or the other midwives of Mecca for their secret draft that was said to poison the womb. But the Messenger of God had made it clear to his small band of followers that the life of a child was sacred, despite the many pagan Arab customs to the contrary. She had sworn an oath of allegiance to his hand, and she would not go against his teachings, even if they meant her demise. Unlike most of her neighbors and friends still clinging to the old ways, Umm Ruman no longer feared death. But she grieved to think that her child, the first to be born into the new faith of Islam, might not survive to see the sunrise.</p><p>Amal took her hand and squeezed it gently.</p><p>"Do not despair. We will get through this together." Her voice was kind, but Umm Ruman could see in the stern lines around her mouth that Amal had reached her professional conclusion. The end was nigh for mother and child.</p><p>Umm Ruman managed to turn her head to her stepdaughter, Asma, who stood frozen at her side, tears welling in her dark eyes.</p><p>"Go. Bring Abu Bakr to me," she said, her voice growing faint. She stroked the girl's still plump cheeks. "If I die before you return, tell him my last request was that the Prophet pray at my funeral."</p><p>Asma shook her head, refusing to face that possibility. "You can't die! I won't let you!"</p><p>The girl was not of Umm Ruman's flesh, but the bond between them was as strong as that of any mother and daughter. Perhaps stronger, for Asma had chosen her over her actual mother, Qutaila, who had refused to accept the new faith. Abu Bakr had divorced his first wife, for it was forbidden for a believer to share a bed with an idol worshiper. The proud Qutaila had left their home in a furious rage, vowing to return to her tribe, but Asma had refused to go with her. The girl had chosen the Straight Path, the way of the Messenger and her father, Abu Bakr. That had been three years ago, and Asma had not seen her mother since. Umm Ruman had felt sorry for the abandoned child, still too young to understand the enormity of her choice, and had raised the girl as her own.</p><p>She wondered what would happen to Asma once she was gone. Abu Bakr would likely look for a new wife, but there were only a handful of believers, and the Message was spreading slowly because of the need for secrecy. If the pagan leaders of Mecca learned the truth of what the Prophet was teaching, their wrath would be kindled, and the tiny community the believers had founded in the shadows would be exposed and destroyed. In all likelihood, Asma would be alone, without any foster mother to guide her through the journey of womanhood. The girl was past due for her cycles, which usually began at the age of ten or eleven for those born under the harsh Arabian sun. The menstrual flow would erupt any day now, but Umm Ruman would not be there to comfort her through the shock of first blood.</p><p>She ran her hand through Asma's brown curls, hoping to bequeath a soft memory with her touch that would comfort the child in the days to come. And then a shock of pain tore through Umm Ruman's womb and she screamed.</p><p>Asma broke free of her stepmother's grasp. She fell back, stumbling over one of the bricks that the midwife had placed at Umm Ruman's swollen feet. As Amal searched desperately through her midwife's stores for a salve to ease her patient's agony, the girl turned and ran in search of her father.</p><p>Umm Ruman closed her eyes and said silent prayer even as her body burned from within.</p><p>As her uterus contracted with increasing urgency, she could feel the baby shifting, preparing to emerge into the world. A process that in all likelihood would lead to her death, and possibly the baby's as well.</p><p>It was the beginning of the end, she thought sadly.</p><p>Umm Ruman was right. But in ways she could not have expected.</p><p>�</p><p>My father, Abu Bakr, walked through the quiet streets of Mecca, his head bowed low, his back hunched slightly, as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders. Which, of course, it was.</p><p>Tonight everything had changed. And he needed to tell someone. Normally he would have gone straight home after emerging from the Prophet's house, as their dwellings were next door to each other. But after what he had seen and heard tonight, he needed to take a walk.</p><p>And besides, his wife had entered labor earlier that day, and his home was now the exclusive domain of the midwife. Abu Bakr had learned through the birth of two sons and a daughter to give the tribe of women its privacy at such moments. A man could only serve as a bumbling annoyance or a dangerous distraction to the sacred rituals of birth. And the safe delivery of this child, the first to be born into the Revelation, was important not just to him, but to the entire Muslim community.</p><p>All twenty of them.</p><p>His child. Abu Bakr wondered for a moment what kind of world the baby would grow into. For years he had hoped that the Truth would spread discreetly and in secret until the masters of Mecca were surprised to see that their tribal religion had died in its sleep, to be replaced quietly with the worship of the One God. But tonight had shown him that whatever path Islam would take among these people, it would not be a quiet one.</p><p>He paused to look up at the heavens. There was no moon tonight and the sky was aflame with a legion of stars, the sparkling strands of a cosmic web that testified to the glory of the Lord. The foolish among his people believed that the future could be discerned in the shimmering patterns that played across the heavens. But Abu Bakr knew that such superstitions were a delusion. Only God knew the future. The greatest of storytellers, every day He surprised man with a new tale. Those who thought they could encompass His grand plan with their puny calculations were always humbled.</p><p>Turning a corner in the walled district of Mecca where many of the chieftains of the city lived, he found himself looking out past the hills that surrounded the desert valley to Mount Hira -- the place where God had spoken to a man, even as He did to Moses at Mount Sinai to the north. The mountain, which soared two thousand feet above the desert floor, tapered into a rocky plateau, at the pinnacle of which was hidden a tiny cave. A small, cramped space where no light could enter. And from which Light itself had sprung forth.</p><p>When his childhood friend Muhammad, the orphan son of Abdallah of the clan of Bani Hashim, had emerged from that cave three years ago, he was transformed. He had seen a vision of an angel named Gabriel who had proclaimed him to be God's Messenger to mankind, the final Prophet sent to bring the world out of darkness into light. It was an audacious claim, one that would understandably invite ridicule had it been made by any other man. But Muhammad was different.</p><p>Abu Bakr had known him since they were excited boys traveling with a caravan to the markets of Palestine and Syria. And from the first day he had set eyes on the young Muhammad, Abu Bakr had known that his friend had a destiny. Raised in poverty and humiliation, the boy nonetheless exuded a dignity, a power, that seemed to emanate from another realm. While other youths quickly embraced the sharp business tactics of the Meccan traders as a means of getting ahead in the harsh world of the desert, Muhammad had gained a reputation as <i>Al-Amin</i> -- the Honest One. His reputation for fair dealing brought him respect but little profit, and Abu Bakr had been heartbroken to see his friend live in destitution while less scrupulous young men advanced rapidly.</p><p>And he had been overjoyed as Muhammad's luck finally turned, when he won the heart of Khadija, a lovely -- and wealthy -- widow who had employed the youth to manage her caravans. Khadija had proposed to the penniless Muhammad, and Abu Bakr took great pleasure in seeing his boyhood comrade finally living in affluence among the nobles of Mecca. But Muhammad had never seemed comfortable around wealth, and his sudden prosperity and entry into elite society had only increased his concern for the many who remained poor in the desert valley.</p><p>Abu Bakr had spent many nights talking with his friend through the years as he expressed agitation over the worsening plight of the lower classes of the city. Women and children starved in the valley of Mecca, even as flourishing trade with the Byzantine and Persian empires to the north enriched its tribal chiefs. Muhammad had become increasingly distraught at the daily injustices he witnessed, as the strong preyed on the weak and men used and discarded women, leaving their bastard children to fend for themselves -- in the worst cases, killing infant girls, whose birth was seen as socially undesirable.</p><p>Abu Bakr had not been surprised to see his tormented friend embark on a spiritual path, meditating e...</p>"Superbly written, brilliantly realized." -- Steven Pressfield<br><br>"With insight and sensitivity, and in a beautiful balance of research and imagination, Kamran Pasha sheds light not only on the seminal figure of Aisha but on the origins of Islam. <i>Mother of the Believers</i> is both timely and timeless." -- Karen Essex, author of <i>Leonardo's Swans</i><br><br>"With incredible scholarship and sensitivity, Kamran Pasha has crafted a remarkable tale and one that is long overdue.

This book serves as an authoritative student edition to guide exams and essays.<p> One of Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s early plays of social protest, <em>Mrs Warren&#x2019;s Profession</em> places the protagonist&#x2019;s decision to become a prostitute in the context of the appalling conditions for working class women in Victorian England. Faced with ill health, poverty, and marital servitude on the one hand, and opportunities for financial independence, dignity, and self-worth on the other, Kitty Warren follows her sister into a successful career in prostitution. Shaw&#x2019;s fierce social criticism in this play is driven not by conventional morality, but by anger at the hypocrisy that allows society to condemn prostitution while condoning the discrimination against women that makes prostitution inevitable. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a comprehensive historical and critical introduction; extracts from Shaw&#x2019;s prefaces to the play; Shaw&#x2019;s expurgations of the text; early reviews of the play in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain; and contemporary contextual documents on prostitution, incest, censorship, women&#x2019;s education, and the &#x201c;New Woman.&#x201d; </p></p><h2>Coffee With Nonna: The Best Stories of My Catholic Grandmother</h2><p>During World War II, young Vincent Iezzi was at home with his grandmother in his Philadelphia neighborhood.

Instead, they take you into the mind and heart of the Son of God in a way you may not have thought possible. You will come to understand the inner logic of Jesus ministry: why Jesus life had to take the course it took, why He could not have been the earthly king many were expecting, and why He could not have conformed to the conventional ideas of a warrior, a hero, or even just a successful man.</p> <p>You will even see why He had to be abandoned by everyone including His disciples, yet His Father remained close to Him then, just as He remains close to you now. Your new insight into why Jesus chose His own particular paths will illuminate the paths He is choosing for your now and will help you stay on those paths with gratitude and joy.</p> <p>Let your newfound knowledge of Jesus blossom into joy as directed by these pages you open yourself to the One whose whole being will resound in your heart and will nourish your soul.</p></p><p>Romano Guardini (1885 1968) was ordained a priest in 1910.

Drawing on a wide range of sources, from the Bible and Western mystics to the Vedas and the Bhagavad Gita, he probes human language and silence, adoration and alienation, to find the root of all our experience in God and its special character in Christian encounter with Jesus. He concludes with reflections on the many places - such as love, joy, suffering, pardon, nature, silence, and even evil - where we meet God today.</p><p>Endorsements: "In the context of Raimon Panikkar's massive life's work, this volume stands out as a theological meditation that is also a mystical hymn to the namelessness of God. The gift is Panikkar's ability to approach fundamental religious ideas with a new innocence, and to pierce beneath the fa�ade of theological confusion, division, or laziness. There is an explosive force at work in his words ripping through the text, coloring it with hues and banging out harmonies that leave the reader wanting to probe more deeply and to understand more fully. The Experience of God: Icons of the Mystery is a seamless garment of praise for the religious dimension of life, for the trinitarian structure of reality, and, most of all, for silence." &#x2014; Beverly Lanzetta, Research Scholar, Southwest Institute for Research on Women, University of Arizona Founder, Schola DivinaRaimon Panikkar is one of the world&#39;s leaders in interreligious dialogue and the author of more than thirty books.

What is moderation? What is justice? What is courage? What is good? What is piety? Socrates thought that understanding the perspectives of others on these six great questions would help him become a more excellent human being. Following in Socrates's footsteps, Christopher Phillips&#x2015;"Johnny Appleseed with a master's degree" (<em>Utne Reader</em>)&#x2015;investigates these same questions, beginning in the marketplace of modern-day Athens. He goes on to investigate the timely responses and outlooks of people from different cultures and backgrounds around the world: from Greece and Spain to Japan and Korea, Mexico City, and Chiapas, where the region's indigenous people struggle for fundamental human rights. Phillips also traveled throughout the United States, holding dialogues in diverse communities from New York City to the Navajo Nation. Introducing us to less familiar thinkers in non-Western traditions who were kindred spirits of Socrates, Phillips enlarges our perspectives on life's fundamental questions, creating an innovative world survey of philosophy.</p><p>Christopher Phillips is an educator, author, and pro-democracy activist. Visit him on the Web at www.christopherphillips.com.In his first book, Socrates Cafe, Phillips charmingly recounted how he roamed the country starting philosophical discussion groups inspired by the Socratic method of questioning. Here, Phillips ventures to many lands, including Greece, Japan, South Korea and Mexico, and stages dialogues with people from many backgrounds: Navajo, Confucian, Islamic, Jewish, Catholic. He discusses six questions, each in a separate chapter: What is virtue? What is moderation? What is justice? What is good? What is courage? What is piety? His hope is to "discover an array of timely answers" that may help us achieve "human excellence." The author's own ruminations, and an eclectic selection of published ideas from Tom Sawyer to Thich Nhat Hanh, supplement the 20 or so dialogues. In a final chapter, Phillips argues that the Socratic "pursuit of the virtuous life" may provide a way of countering the "downward [moral] spiral" he sees prevailing in today's world. Phillips's idealism remains refreshing, and the book is valuable for its inclusion of non-European points of view. But as in Socrates Cafe, the philosophy often feels superficial. For example, a discussion in Mexico of "What is justice?" turns into a catalogue of government injustices with nothing more to say philosophically than, "We have to make sure that justice serves all of us in an impartial way." Such insights are obviously not without value, especially for those new to philosophizing, but they make this very much a book for beginners.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was born in Brooklyn in 1909. I don&#x2019;t recall him ever at peace with his life. I do remember him looking serene once at Valley Forge, among the oaks and maples and magnolias; clustered among the numerous birches and pine trees; and a second time among other hardwoods at Fredericksburg. These are trees I could not name when I was young but learned to identify on later visits to those hallowed sites, and to other sites on the Eastern Seaboard that the memory of my father inspired me to see. For it was only at such places, away from our immediate surroundings, that my father became real to me, and real to himself.<br><br>In particular, I remember him at Wheatland, James Buchanan&#x2019;s handsome Federal-style home with the air of a southern plantation in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There I peeked my chin over the protective barriers into sumptuous mid-nineteenth-century rooms, with their dark walnut desks and other antique furniture, along with the French china, glittering crystal, and gilded mirrors. Yes, I remember a grand piano there and many shadowy bookcases and lithographs. For long spans of my childhood my memory is vague, but it lights up with minute detail about what matters most to me. Wheatland, where President Buchanan lived, worked, headquartered his campaign for high office, and died, really mattered to me as a child. I was only nine, but my father in those rare moments spoke to me almost as though I were an adult, even as he was so full of tenderness.<br><br>My father laid out the fundamentals of Buchanan&#x2019;s failure as president, perhaps the worst in our history: a story necessarily simplified for a nine-year-old. Of course, later in life I would fill in most of the details.<br><br>Whatever the multitude of factors in the three-way election of 1856, James Buchanan was by no means an accidental president. When he assumed office in March 1857, he appeared to have everything going for him. Arguably, no man in the country was better qualified for the task of calming the festering North-South split over slavery. He was a tall, reasonably wealthy, self-made, and imposing figure, someone who, aside from being a bachelor, was truly good at life: a former congressman, senator, minister to Russia in the Andrew Jackson administration, secretary of state in the James K. Polk administration, and minister to Great Britain in the Franklin Pierce administration; a talented and accomplished operator, a man of maneuver gifted at the fine art of compromise despite his stubbornness. He knew what buttons to push, in other words. Who else was possessed of the political savvy necessary to save the Union? Few were shrewder. Except for one thing, as it would turn out: Buchanan did not have a compass point toward which to navigate in the midst of all the deals he tried to make, and he had a distinct and fatal sympathy for the South. But mostly he was all ambition and technique without direction. Moreover, he was a literalist. He had a small vision of the Constitution and the frontier nation: he did not believe he and the federal government had the right to dictate terms to the southern states. He saw the good in both the pro-slavery and anti-slavery points of view. With his legalistic flair, he might have made a very competent president in more ordinary times; he was a disaster in extraordinary times. The country finally came apart under his watch. &#x201c;It turned out, he just, ehhh, didn&#x2019;t have what it takes,&#x201d; a father whispered to a nine-year-old boy at Wheatland.<br><br>The basic security of the world in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has depended greatly upon the political unity of the temperate zone of North America. And that almost didn&#x2019;t happen. It was my knowledge of both Buchanan&#x2019;s many gifts and his abject personal failure as president&#x2014;a knowledge first granted me by my father&#x2014;that provided me with a deeper awareness of just how difficult making epochal decisions in the moment of crisis can be. It was this very awareness about Buchanan&#x2014;how good he looked at the beginning of his administration and how bad he turned out&#x2014;that always made me think later in life, Thank God we had Lincoln. What Buchanan ultimately lacked, despite his r�sum�, Lincoln had in abundance: character.<br><br>But Buchanan&#x2019;s failure was secondary in my father&#x2019;s eyes that day at Wheatland; primary was the fact that Buchanan was, nevertheless, part of the vital tapestry of American history. Therefore, he was well worth knowing about. Great presidents cannot be understood in isolation; one requires knowledge of the not-great presidents who preceded and succeeded them. Indeed, we need always to see history as a whole, we cannot appreciate the good without knowing the bad, and vice versa. This is especially true of westward expansion. Wheatland made America&#x2019;s past come alive for me.<br><br>It was at a hotel in Lancaster during that same trip that my parents bought me a volume of American travel articles written in easy Reader&#x2019;s Digest style, suited to my age. One story was about a family driving west and stopping for breakfast at a diner somewhere in Nebraska perhaps, on the Great Plains (or the Great American Desert as it was once known), anticipating the sight of the Rocky Mountains, where they were headed. &#x201c;You have to earn the Rockies,&#x201d; the father says to his wife and children, in my piercing if inaccurate childhood recollection of the story, by driving across the flat Midwest and Plains. Perhaps it was &#x201c;meet the challenge of the Rockies.&#x201d; In any case, earn the Rockies is a phrase that has stayed with me my whole life. It sums up America&#x2019;s continental geography, the continent that Lincoln united and realized, and the significance of the Rocky Mountains as a geographical fact that should only be encountered by first crossing the Eastern Seaboard, the Middle West, and the Great American Desert, for that was the way that they were encountered in all their sudden and terrifying magnificence by European settlers and pathfinders, those who could not have known what exactly lay over the horizon.<br><br>Throughout my childhood I yearned to see mountains higher than the Appalachians. As a family, we never left the eastern states. The Rockies were just too far, and my parents simply lacked the means, though my father talked about them often. The phrase earn the Rockies helped spur me to travel, something also instilled in me by my father since I can remember.<br><br>My mother and father took me on that trip through Pennsylvania in 1962. Alaska and Hawaii had only recently been admitted to the Union. The United States back then, for a while yet, still thought of itself as only a continental nation, stretching, according to both the song and the clich�, from sea to shining sea. To this day, Alaskans refer to the rest of the country as &#x201c;the Lower 48,&#x201d; meaning the contiguous forty-eight states that constitute the temperate zone of North America. Arizona was the last of the Lower 48, admitted to the Union only in 1912, a little closer in time to that trip through Pennsylvania than that trip through Pennsylvania was to the moment at which I write.<br><br>America was a different country then, vaster and emptier. Valley Forge was not in the suburbs of Greater Philadelphia as it is now, nor Fredericksburg near the suburbs of Greater Washington, D.C. Food was more distinctive&#x2014;with far fewer chain restaurants and grits widespread in eating facilities just south of the nation&#x2019;s capital. People drove and rode buses, or hitchhiked across America&#x2014;as I did in the summer of 1970&#x2014;much more often than they flew. The Interstate Highway System was spanking new, and thus the Pennsylvania Turnpike and New York State Thruway constituted exotic experiences, with rest stops offering sit-down dining with waiters and waitresses. Those magical highways could transport you from the Atlantic Seaboard all the way to the very rim of the Midwest! The East Coast was much more of an adventure then than it is now. And there were few crowds anywhere.<br><br>It had its dark side, though. I remember stopping for lunch with my parents at a restaurant called Lowery&#x2019;s in Tappahannock, Virginia. It was the spring of 1964, just a few months before the Civil Rights Act, and we were returning north from a visit to the Yorktown Battlefield. There was a sign at the entrance as we opened the door: &#x201c;Whites Only.&#x201d; I saw my parents look uneasily at each other, something that communicated fear to an eleven-year-old boy. We went inside, ate quietly, and noticed everyone glancing at us. It was clear that we were not locals and therefore not entirely welcome.<br><br>Those trips were the gemstones of my childhood. It is in the midst of recalling them that I cherish the memory of my parents the most. Returning from those trips I was able to see, as though a shocked outsider, the grainy, almost black-and-white surroundings of our home in Queens: the sooty fire escape and other blockhouse apartments were the only view from the stifling kitchen where we ate. Because of the clash between where we had been and where we lived, those early travels, I believe, burdened me with something I was never entirely comfortable with: a cruel objectivity. In the morning we had been at Wheatland seeing the feast of glittering greenery outside James Buchanan&#x2019;s mansion; that same night we were back in our apartment, hearing the yelling of our neighbors in other apartments. Seeing the wider world, if only a glimpse of it, had come with a price. I learned early that comparison is painful and not always polite, but it is at the root of all serious analysis.<br><br>My father was a truck driver with a high school education who listened to classical music on WQXR while breezing through the New York Times Sunday and weekday crossword puzzles. He had a small record collection that included the patriotic band music of John Philip Sousa and the hits of Al Jolson, mixed with a little Stephen Foster. It was music that took you from the mid-nineteenth century to the first decades of the twentieth, telegraphing the country&#x2019;s latent dynamism as it crept toward World War II. There was also in this singular and awkward repertoire the haunting twangs of Ferde Grof�&#x2019;s Grand Canyon Suite from 1931, with their hopeful intimations of travel. In the 1960s, my father was decades behind his time. As I grew into middle age, I realized how grateful I was for it.<br><br>In the spring of 1961, my father took my family, including my older brother and a cousin, on a trip to Washington, D.C. It was particularly memorable because on the second night he got us tickets to hear the Marine Band play Sousa at Constitution Hall. Between such transformative moments&#x2014;Wheatland, the Marine Band&#x2014;was the weeping undertow of my childhood: every late afternoon, my father, hunched over the unmade bed that was visible from the windows of apartment houses directly across, tying the laces on his work boots, lost briefly in a trance, preparing for another night of driving in the partial wasteland of Brooklyn. Facing him in the bedroom was his small collection of books, two shelves actually. I remember The Conquest of Everest by Sir John Hunt (1954), Beyond the High Himalayas by William O. Douglas (1952), Jefferson the Virginian by Dumas Malone (1948), and one he had just bought, and that he anticipated reading: Travels with Charley: In Search of America by John Steinbeck (1962).<br><br>In the 1930s my father had spent his twenties riding railway cars around the United States, earning a living as a horse-racing tout in forty-three of the lower forty-eight states. After a &#x201c;big score&#x201d; he would check into a first-class hotel, a large cigar in hand: twenty-four hours later, he would be living a hobo&#x2019;s existence like so many others in the 1930s. He filled me with stories of his escapades in Depression-era America, and of the predominant image of a still-pastoral and na�ve nation, where the scams he ran were relatively innocent and people bought you a meal when you were down and out. I have a picture of him, powerful in the way of a photo negative, with a jacket and tie and sharp fedora, wearing a confident smile with which I could never associate him when I was a child, taken at the Texas State Fair in Dallas: the year &#x201c;1933&#x201d; emblazoned above him.<br><br>Beulah Park (Columbus, Ohio), Arlington Downs (Dallas&#x2013;Fort Worth), Churchill Downs, where he watched Bold Venture win the Kentucky Derby in 1936&#x2014;my father knew literally every racetrack in the country. There were Houston and New Orleans in the winter of 1933&#x2013;34; by freight train (the Union Pacific) from Pittsburgh to Chicago to Las Vegas the following year; sick, broke, back on his feet. It was an epic existence, however aimless, seedy, and pathetic at the edges, as well as full of exaggeration in the telling.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s last memory of travel was in 1942. He had just completed basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and was heading north on a troop train for dispatch to Europe, where he would serve in the U.S. Army Eighth Air Force in England. At a rail junction near Cairo, Illinois, the sun was setting in rich colors over the prairie. Other trains were then converging from several tracks onto a single line that would take the troops to points along the East Coast, where ships to Europe awaited. Across a wide arc, the only thing he saw were trains and more trains, with soldiers looking out through every window as each train curved toward the others against a flat and limitless landscape lit red by the sun. &#x201c;Just looking at that scene, that&#x2019;s the moment when I knew we were going to win the war,&#x201d; he said to me, smiling briefly at the recollection as he completed tying his shoelaces.<br><br>My first map of the United States was composed of my father&#x2019;s images. It was a landscape full of lessons and marvels that I desperately wanted to experience firsthand. The flat prairie was something I never imagined as dull but, rather, as an immense and magnificent prelude to something grander. I thank my father for that. And thus I would make several journeys from coast to coast: once in my late teens, hitchhiking, fueled with curiosity, obsessed with just seeing the West; then as a middle-aged journalist, writing about social, regional, and environmental issues; and now, finally, in my middle sixties, somewhat chastened by international events, hoping to learn something about America&#x2019;s place in the world by simply looking at the country around me.</p><h2>Building and Dwelling: Ethics for the City</h2><p><p><b>A preeminent thinker redefines the meaning of city life and charts a way forward</b><br><i></i><br><i>Building and Dwelling </i>is the definitive statement on cities by the renowned public intellectual Richard Sennett. In this sweeping work, he traces the anguished relation between how cities are built and how people live in them, from ancient Athens to twenty-first-century Shanghai. He shows how Paris, Barcelona, and New York City assumed their modern forms; rethinks the reputations of Jane Jacobs, Lewis Mumford, and others; and takes us on a tour of emblematic contemporary locations, from the backstreets of Medell�n, Colombia, to the Google headquarters in Manhattan. Through it all, he laments that the &#x201c;closed city&#x201d;&#x2015;segregated, regimented, and controlled&#x2015;has spread from the global North to the exploding urban agglomerations of the global South. As an alternative, he argues for the &#x201c;open city,&#x201d; where citizens actively hash out their differences and planners experiment with urban forms that make it easier for residents to cope. Rich with arguments that speak directly to our moment&#x2015;a time when more humans live in urban spaces than ever before&#x2015;<i>Building and Dwelling</i> draws on Sennett&#x2019;s deep learning and intimate engagement with city life to form a bold and original vision for the future of cities.</p></p><p><b>Richard Sennett</b> is the author of <i>The Craftsman</i>, <i>The Fall of Public Man</i>, and <i>The Corrosion of Character</i>. He teaches urban studies at the London School of Economics and at Harvard University, and is a senior fellow in Columbia University&#x2019;s Center for Capitalism and Society. For thirty years, he has directed projects under the auspices of the UN that aim to guide urban development in the twenty-first century.<p>"No one knows more than [Sennett] about cities and the efforts that have been made over the past two centuries to order and plan them to make them more liveable for their inhabitants. It is this eternally problematic relationship between the city&#x2019;s form &#x2013; buildings, streets, highways, transport networks &#x2013; and the quality of collective life it can offer its citizens, that has been at the heart of his life-long project as an urbanist and practising planner." <b>&#x2015;Jerry White, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b></p><p><i>"</i>The sociologist and urbanist Richard Sennett is a thoughtful writer with far-ranging interests and a keen eye for hidden patterns and complex processes that may escape the casual observer. He has always been a pleasure to read. His first book, <i>The Uses of Disorder</i>, published almost 50 years ago (1970), was a reflection on the value of anti-authoritarian or anti-hierarchical &#x201c;anarchy&#x201d; in city life, and his new book, his 15th, is a more elaborate, and more sophisticated, take on his original insights." <b>&#x2015;Shlomo Angel, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>"[<i>Building and Dwelling</i>] distills into a single volume [Sennett's] thoughts on how urban design shapes the ways we relate to one another . . . Sennett is as passionate as ever about the richness and complexity of public life . . .

Often brilliant . . . Essential reading for all students of the city." <b> &#x2015;Anna Minton, <i>Prospect</i></b></p><p>"[<i>Building and Dwelling</i>] reads like the summation of a life lived in cities and is, ultimately, a paean to their unpredictability, a call for tolerance and a celebration of difference." &#x2015;<b>Edwin Heathcote, </b><i><b>The Financial Times</b></i></p><p>"<i>Building and Dwelling</i> is a big-hearted book that celebrates cities as it theorizes them.

"<b> &#x2015;Ryne Clos, </b><i><b>Spectrum Culture</b></i></p><p>"Sociology professor at both LSE and Harvard, [Richard Sennett] embodies Ruskin&#x2019;s belief that &#x201c;of thousands who can think, there is one who can see&#x201d;.

Other Chelsea residents past and present who will be included: Ryan Adams, club kid/murderer Michael Alig, Sarah Bernhardt, the Warhol Factory's Richard Bernstein, Victor Bockris, Charles Bukowski, Leonard Cohen, Lesbian activist Storme DeLarverie, Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Huncke, Janis Joplin, Jack Kerouac, Madonna, Edgar Lee Masters, Arthur Miller, Edie Sedgwick, Sam Shepard, Patti Smith, Dylan Thomas, and Rufus Wainwright.</p><p>&nbsp;Ed&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;is the author of "Legends of the Chelsea Hotel" and "The Chintz Age: Tales of Love and Loss for a New New York." &nbsp;He was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in Louisville, Kentucky.&nbsp; He has a BA in Psychology from the University of Kentucky and an MA in Philosophy from the University of Louisville.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed's fiction has appeared in dozens of small journals, magazines and newspapers, including&nbsp;<i>Exquisite Corpse</i>,<i>&nbsp;Limestone</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Journal of Kentucky Studies</i>,&nbsp;<i>SOMA Review</i>,<i>Bohemia</i>,&nbsp;<i>Omphalos</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Wilderness Review</i>&nbsp;and in translation in the Czech Republic's&nbsp;<i>Host</i>.&nbsp; His non-fiction has appeared in <i>The Village</i>r, <i>Chelsea Now</i>, and<i> the Huffington Pos</i>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed&nbsp;currently live in NYC.<strong><em>New York Times Book Review, 10/28/07 </em></strong>By JEFF GILES<br><br>"One of the recurring pleasures of Ed Hamilton's "Legends of the Chelsea Hotel" is his sly rendering of its former proprietor, Stanley Bard, an eccentric patron of the arts who almost pathologically refused to acknowledge that the Chelsea was anything other than a crystal palace inhabited by muses and magicians. Early in the book, Hamilton passes along a former tenant's story of seeing a swarm of policemen on the ninth floor and assuming that Joe the junkie had finally OD'd. Bard corrected him: the police officers were in fact guests at the hotel, and the junkie was vacationing abroad. The tenant, it seems, had been misled by the stretcher, the corpse and the body bag. <br>In "Legends," Hamilton evokes a similar sense that the past and the present are constant bedfellows on 23rd Street. The book may be uneven and overstuffed, but there's something remarkable about the way the author manages to celebrate the Chelsea's singular atmosphere -- the exuberant aspiring artists, the divorced movie stars, the disheveled blonde who may have Tourette's who lingers in the lobby hissing like a snake -- without ever forgetting how toxic the air is for many of the people who come desperate to breathe it."<br><br><strong>Kansas City&#x2019;s <em>Pitch Weekly</em> blog, 2/11/10</strong><br><br> &#x201c;I recommend picking up Ed Hamilton&#x2019;s <em>Legends of the Chelsea Hotel</em>, which has many more stories of the famous landmark where Smith, Mapplethorpe, and many other renowned writers, musicians, and artists stayed.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Memoirs of My Life (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>The eighteenth-century British historian provides an account of his childhood, education, travels, and composition of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</p><p>Edward Gibbon (1737 - 1794) was arguably the most influential historian since the time of Tacitus.

Described as a "brilliant dark novel" (<em>Scotland on Sunday</em>), the book now takes a wild swerve in its new volume. Skillfully constructed around a central perplexing and mesmerizing scene in a nightclub, <em>Volume Two: Dance and Dream</em> again features Jacques Deza. In Volume One he was hired by MI6 as a person of extraordinarily sophisticated powers of perception. In Volume Two Deza discovers the dark side of his new employer when Tupra, his spy-master boss, brings out a sword and uses it in a way that appalls Deza: You can't just go around hurting and killing people like that. Why not? asks Tupra.<br><br> Searching meditations on favors and jealousy, knowledge and the deep human desire not to know, violence and death play against memories of the Spanish Civil War as Deza's world becomes increasingly murky.</p><p><p><strong>Javier Mar�as</strong> is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen. He has held academic posts in Spain, the US (he was a visiting professor at Wellesley College) and Britain, as a lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University. He has been translated into 34 languages, and more than six million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1997 he won the Nelly Sachs Award; the Comunidad de Madrid award in 1998; in 2000 the Grinzane Cavour Award, the Alberto Moravia Prize, and the Dublin IMPAC Award. He also won the Spanish National Translation Award in 1979 for his translation of <em>Tristram Shandy</em> in 1979. He was a professor at Oxford University and the Complutense of Madrid. He currently lives in Madrid.</p><p><strong>MARGARET JULL COSTA</strong> is a three-time winner of the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. For New Directions, she has translated works by Rafael Chirbes, Javier Mar�as, Fernando Pessoa, E�a de Queir�s, and Enrique Vila-Matas.</p>The spy story is incidental to acclaimed Spanish novelist Mar�as's elegant but prolix second volume of a projected trilogy (after Fever and Spear) narrated by Jacques (or Jaime) Deza, a Spanish expat in London and former Oxford instructor working as an analyst for the intelligence service MI5. Deza's inscrutable, nihilistic handler, Bertram Tupra, doesn't clarify Deza's mission when he brings him to a nightclub to accompany the wife of a contact. There, Tupra terrorizes and beats a man for hitting on the wrong woman. Though this central action unfolds at length, Mar�as's real concern-evidenced by the dense but not always incisive philosophizing that makes up this mostly internal novel-is the process of reflection rather than the ideas themselves. Like Mar�as, Deza is an accomplished translator, keenly aware of the imprecision of language; his inner monologues sprawl and fold back in on themselves. In the novel's most compelling section, though, Deza recounts his father's recollections of the Spanish Civil War, which revealed the capacity of ordinary people to commit and then disassociate themselves from extraordinary brutality. With the elder Deza's voice, Mar�as demonstrates his adroitness at narrative, which makes the rest of the digressive novel all the more frustrating.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We wanted to show how new strategies, many of them driven by online technology, make it possible to serve more students at lower cost while also increasing quality and improving the learning experience--something we saw in practice within our own university homes. Since then, the world has moved into a major economic downturn. Slow economic growth, high government and household debt, rising college tuition, declining graduation rates, and growing competition from the rapidly growing for-profit higher education sector combined to create a renewed sense of urgency for our message. We could see how the same online learning technologies that can benefit traditional institutions can also disrupt them. So, our message became cautiously optimistic. Online learning, we believe, will either disrupt traditional universities and colleges or create opportunities for them to serve more students and lead the country to greater prosperity. It depends on whether they cling to a model that has changed little in the past 150 years or embrace learning innovations made possible by new technology. <br><br> <b>What forces are threatening traditional universities, and why does preserving them matter? </b><br> Traditional universities are an indispensable cornerstone of society and culture. The college experience is transformative for so many people, and it is an experience people cannot get elsewhere. <br><br> But while we can&#x2019;t afford to lose the traditional college experience, we also can't afford to support it on its current trajectory. In their race to constantly make themselves bigger and better, colleges and university have steadily driven up cost. They've lost focus on their once-modest missions and are now unsustainably overstretched and overcommitted. The economic downturn is exposing them, as seen by the increasing number of students who are jumping ship to alternative forms of higher education like community colleges, for-profit universities, technical institutes and online degree programs. <br><br> We assert that colleges and universities must break with tradition and find innovative, less costly ways of performing their uniquely valuable functions, allowing them to once again become responsive to the needs of learners. <br><br> <b>Why do you advocate for colleges and universities to embrace online education? </b><br> Online technology makes a college or university vastly more attractive to a wide subset of students. It gives many people a second chance at learning &#x2013; i.e. those who cannot afford a traditional college education, those who do not have the flexibility to take part in a full plate of coursework, and late bloomers or dropouts who have fallen behind and now have the chance to catch up. <br><br> But online learning doesn't just offer cheaper education for the masses. It improves the student learning experience across the spectrum by allowing remedial to elite students to learn at their own pace and on their own timetable. Students can receive a fully customized education adapted to their own individual learning style, something that even the world's best one-on-one tutor would have trouble systematically emulating. Students also benefit from a full array of choices about where, when, what and how they learn. And they can access the best teachers and information faster, connect with more global networks, and all in all consume a much more attractive produce. In addition, online learning is a cost-saver to the university, which saves on the expense of building and managing a brick-and-mortar facility. <br><br> Combine the lower cost of delivery with the lower cost of attendance, and it&#x2019;s clear that online learning is a major cost advantage. Therefore, we urge traditional colleges and universities to adopt these technologies. <br><br> <b>What do the histories of Harvard and BYU-Idaho show us about the future of higher education? </b><br> The stories of the development, evolution and continuing innovation of Harvard and BYU-Idaho show that universities can prosper if they are very thoughtful about what they choose to do. Harvard has always made choices to ensure that it serves the students and communities it promises to serve at very high quality, and because it has the necessary resources, its model is sustainable. It isn&#x2019;t an imitator. BYU-Idaho is similar. Although it has much more limited resources, BYU-Idaho has decided which constituencies it wants to serve and how to capably serve them, ultimately succeeding at providing higher quality education at lower cost. The overarching message for university leaders is that you can and must change your university &#x201c;DNA.&#x201d; You can and must make clear choices and innovate. <br> <b>Why is now the right time to take a hard look at our education system and ensure we plan for a competitive future? </b> The new economic and social environment presents some big sticks, but even bigger carrots. Healthcare obligations have squeezed the ability of states to fund higher education. Only deficit spending &#x2013; which can&#x2019;t continue at the current rate &#x2013; has allowed the federal government to sustain its student financial aid and research funding. Simultaneously, risk-free investment rates of return have fallen, creating a funding problem for even well-endowed private schools. On top of that, for-profit educators have the capacity, if they choose, to lower their prices to attract traditional college students in greater numbers. Disruption of the old model of higher education is imminent. <br><br> Fortunately, the need for higher education has never been greater. The bursting of the housing bubble is just one indicator of the vulnerability of the middle class. Cheap credit isn't enough to raise or even maintain their standard of living in this global competitive environment. We need to provide much broader access to excellent higher education. The institutions that find ways to serve more students at high quality and affordable cost can control their destiny rather than be disrupted. In the process they may be able to work the kinds of miracles they did in the post-Civil War and World War II eras. <br><br></p><p><p><b>PRAISE FOR THE INNOVATIVE UNIVERSITY</b> </p><p>"This superbly documented book is a must read for anyone who cares about America's universities and colleges and the invaluable role they play in our contemporary society. Henry Eyring and Clayton Christensen remind us of higher education's history and thoughtfully examine the critical strands of its DNA that require 're-engineering' to insure survival and good health for our richly diverse system.

Schlesinger,</b> president, Babson College</p><p><b>THE INNOVATIVE UNIVERSITY</b> </p><p>The language of crisis is nothing new in higher education--for years critics have raised alarms about rising tuition, compromised access, out of control costs, and a host of other issues. Yet, though those issues are still part of the current crisis, it is not the same as past ones. For the first time, disruptive technologies are at work in higher education. For most of their histories, traditional universities and colleges have had no serious competition except from institutions with similar operating models. Now, though, there are disruptive competitors offering online degrees. Many of these institutions operate as for-profit entities, emphasizing marketable degrees for working adults. Traditional colleges and universities have valuable qualities and capacities that can offset those disruptors' advantages--but not for everyone who aspires to higher education, and not without real innovation. How can institutions of higher education think constructively and creatively about their response to impending disruption? </p><p>Written by Clayton Christensen, the father of the theory of disruptive innovation, and his colleague, Henry J. Eyring, <i>The Innovative University</i> offers a nuanced and hopeful analysis of the traditional university and its DNA. It explores how and why universities must change to ensure future success. </p><p>Throughout the book Christensen and Eyring show what it takes to apply Christensen's acclaimed model of disruptive innovation to a higher education environment. Through a penetrating examination of the histories and current transformations of two very different universities--Harvard and BYU-Idaho--and using other illustrative examples of innovation in higher education, <i>The Innovative University</i> explores how universities can find innovative, less costly ways of performing their uniquely valuable functions and thereby save themselves from decline. The book explores the strategic choices and alternative ways in which traditional universities can change to ensure their ongoing economic vitality. To avoid the pitfalls of disruption and turn the scenario into a positive and productive one, universities must re-engineer their institutional DNA from the inside out. </p><p><i>The Innovative University</i> reveals how the traditional university survives by breaking with tradition, but thrives by building upon what it's done best.</p></p><h2>Focus on Grammar 4 with MyEnglishLab (5th Edition)</h2><p><p>Building on the success of previous editions, <b> <i>Focus on Grammar</i> </b>, Fifth Edition continues to leverage its successful four-step approach that lets learners move from comprehension to communication within a clear and consistent structure.

Alicia Hern�ndez Ch�vez takes into account new historiography&#x2015;which is fully integrated with anthropology, political science, economics, and international relations&#x2015;to present an original and fresh interpretation of the structures and processes that determined the country's evolution. Based on the latest sources in both Spanish and other languages, this book illustrates that Mexico's history&#x2015;far from being one of violent change, uprisings, and revolution&#x2015;tended more toward stability and political collaboration. Hern�ndez Ch�vez argues that Mexicans relied on tradition and institutions to effect change, resorting to disorder and destruction as little as possible. Numerous maps, tables, and charts support the text, providing extensive information on geography, social structures, the economy, politics, education, health, and transportation.</p><p><b>Alicia Hern�ndez Ch�vez</b> is Professor at the Centro de Estudios Hist�ricos at El Colegio de M�xico.

Made at the time when the old studio system was breaking up, it functions both as an embodiment of the supremely seductive visual pleasures that 'classical Hollywood' could offer and &#x2013; with the help of an elaborate plot twist &#x2013; as a laying bare of their dangerous dark side. The film's core is a study in romantic obsession, as James Stewart's Scottie pursues Madeleine/Judy (Kim Novak) to her death in a remote Californian mission. Novak is ice cool but vulnerable, Stewart &#x2013; in the darkest role of his career &#x2013; genial on the surface but damaged within. </p><p>Although it can be seen as Hitchcock's most personal film, Charles Barr argues that, like Citizen Kane, Vertigo is at the same time a triumph not so much of individual authorship as of creative collaboration. He highlights the crucial role of screenwriters Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor and, by a combination of textual and contextual analysis, explores the reasons why Vertigo continues to inspire such fascination. </p><p>In his foreword to this special edition, published to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the BFI Film Classics series, Barr looks afresh at Vertigo alongside the recently-rediscovered 'lost' silent The White Shadow (1924), scripted by Hitchcock, which also features the trope of the double, and at the acclaimed contemporary silent film The Artist (2011), which pays explicit homage to Vertigo in its soundtrack.</p></p><p>CHARLES BARR was formerly Professor of Film Studies at the University of East Anglia.

Like enzymes, they are diverse and ubiquitous macromolecular catalysts with high substrate specificity and subject to strong regulation. This fully revised and expanded third edition of <em>Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes</em> describes the known channels and their physiological functions, then develops the conceptual background needed to understand their architecture and molecular mechanisms of operation. It includes new chapters on calcium signaling, structural biology, and molecular biology and genomics. <em>Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes</em> begins with the classical biophysical work of Hodgkin and Huxley, continues with the roles of channels in cellular signaling, then develops the physical and molecular principles needed for explaining permeation, gating, pharmacological modification, and molecular diversity, and ends with a discussion of channel evolution.<em> Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes</em> is written to be accessible and interesting to life scientists and physical scientists of all kinds. It introduces all the concepts that a graduate student should be aware of but is also effective in advanced undergraduate courses. It has long been the recognized authoritative overview of this field used by all neuroscientists.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bertil Hille</strong> is Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington.

With sharp analytic insight, Peter Heather explores the dynamics of migration and social and economic interaction that changed two vastly different worlds--the undeveloped barbarian world and the sophisticated Roman Empire--into remarkably similar societies and states. <br><br>The book's vivid narrative begins at the time of Christ, when the Mediterranean circle, newly united under the Romans, hosted a politically sophisticated, economically advanced, and culturally developed civilization--one with philosophy, banking, professional armies, literature, stunning architecture, even garbage collection. The rest of Europe, meanwhile, was home to subsistence farmers living in small groups, dominated largely by Germanic speakers. Although having some iron tools and weapons, these mostly illiterate peoples worked mainly in wood and never built in stone. The farther east one went, the simpler it became: fewer iron tools and ever less productive economies. And yet ten centuries later, from the Atlantic to the Urals, the European world had turned. Slavic speakers had largely superseded Germanic speakers in central and Eastern Europe, literacy was growing, Christianity had spread, and most fundamentally, Mediterranean supremacy was broken.<br><br>Bringing the whole of first millennium European history together, and challenging current arguments that migration played but a tiny role in this unfolding narrative, <em>Empires and Barbarians</em> views the destruction of the ancient world order in light of modern migration and globalization patterns.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Heather</strong> is Professor of Medieval History at King's College London.

The result is a book which richly merits reading by those interested in the future of Europe as well as its past."--Tom Holland, <em>BBC History Magazine</em> <br><p></p><br>"Most immediately impressive is Heather's easy command of detail. A jaunty, man of the people prose style masks a sure and scholarly grip on the history and archaeology of the first millenniem A.D. One of Heather's most attractive strengths is his eye for comparision. He neatly sets his thinking about first-millennium migration against modern experiences of the lure of the New World or the desperate flight of Kosovar or Rwandan refugees."--Christopher Kelly, <em>Literary Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Peter Heather's book is an important contribution to the field--the first up-to-date book that compares the Germanic and the Slav migrations of the early middle ages.

Usually the human is considered a hazard - a system component whose unsafe acts are implicated in the majority of catastrophic breakdowns. However there is another perspective that has been relatively little studied in its own right - the human as hero, whose adaptations and compensations bring troubled systems back from the brink of disaster time and again. What, if anything, did these situations have in common? Can these human abilities be &#x2019;bottled&#x2019; and passed on to others? The Human Contribution is vital reading for all professionals in high-consequence environments and for managers of any complex system. The book draws its illustrative material from a wide variety of hazardous domains, with the emphasis on healthcare reflecting the author&#x2019;s focus on patient safety over the last decade.

Each organization must have a standing health care ethics committee to maintain its status. These interdisciplinary committees are composed of physicians, nurses, attorneys, ethicists, administrators, and interested citizens. Their main function is to review and provide resolutions for specific, individual patient care problems. Many of these committees are well meaning but may lack the information, experience, skills, and formal background in bioethics needed to adequately negotiate the complex ethical issues that arise in clinical and organizational settings.</p><p><i>Handbook for Health Care Ethics Committees</i> was the first book of its kind to address the myriad responsibilities faced by ethics committees, including education, case consultation, and policy development. Adopting an accessible tone and using a case study format, the authors explore serious issues involving informed consent and refusal, decision making and decisional capacity, truth telling, the end of life, palliative care, justice in and access to health care services, and organizational ethics.</p><p>The authors have thoroughly updated the content and expanded their focus in the second edition to include ethics committees in other clinical settings, such as long-term care facilities, small community hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and hospices.

When it was published in 1943, Isabel Paterson's work provided fresh intellectual support for the endangered American belief in individual rights, limited government, and economic freedom. The crisis of today's collectivized nations would not have surprised Paterson; in <em>The God of the Machine, </em>she had explored the reasons for collectivism's failure. Her book placed her in the vanguard of the free-enterprise movement now sweeping the world.</p><p>Paterson sees the individual creative mind as the dynamo of history, and respect for the individual's God-given rights as the precondition for the enormous release of energy that produced the modern world. She sees capitalist institutions as the machinery through which human energy works, and government as a device properly used merely to cut off power to activities that threaten personal liberty.</p><p>Paterson applies her general theory to particular issues in contemporary life, such as education, .social welfare, and the causes of economic distress. She severely criticizes all but minimal application of government, including governmental interventions that most people have long taken for granted. <em>The God of the Machine </em>offers a challenging perspective on the continuing, worldwide debate about the nature of freedom, the uses of power, and the prospects of human betterment.</p><p>Stephen Cox's substantial introduction to <em>The God of the Machine </em>is a comprehensive and enlightening account of Paterson's colorful life and work. He describes <em>The God of the Machine </em>as "not just theory, but rhapsody, satire, diatribe, poetic narrative." Paterson's work continues to be relevant because "it exposes the moral and practical failures of collectivism, failures that are now almost universally acknowledged but are still far from universally understood." The book will be essential to students of American history, political theory, and literature.</p></p><p><p><em>Isabel Paterson </em>(1886-1961) was a journalist, critic, and author of nine books. She is considered to be one of the founders of American libertarianism.</p><p> "The God of the Machine remains a classic of individualist thought.

The method set forth in this book is unsurpassed in obtaining the greatest amount of physical and psychological information about an individual. Although based on traditional methods, it is contemporary because it recognizes that pulse diagnosis must continue to develop over time. In the hands of master pulse diagnostician Dr. John Shen, his apprentice Dr. Leon Hammer, and their students, it has evolved in recent decades to better reflect modern times and lifestyles. This handbook summarizes the key elements of Chinese Pulse Diagnosis: A Contemporary Approach in a portable edition. It is the result of the very hard work, by many practitioners, of extracting the essentials from each area of this subject. The present volume offers a clear and practical path toward a better understanding of traditional pulse diagnosis, while recasting its interpretation in the context of our own times. The book is organized in eighteen chapters. The early chapters consider such general issues as terminology, classification of pulse qualities, historical comparisons of positions and depths, and a methodology for taking the pulse. The middle chapters provide an in-depth look at each of the individual pulse qualities, identified by felt sensation based on such characteristics as rate and rhythm, stability, volume, depth, size, and shape. The types of pathology associated with each of the qualities are also discussed. Later chapters examine the significance of the qualities when found across the entire pulse, or large segments of the pulse, and at different depths. The relationship of the pulse qualities to psychology and prognosis are addressed in separate chapters. The final chapters on interpretation and case histories draw everything together to show how this information can be formulated into a rational diagnosis. Key information in the book is organized and richly illustrated in over a hundred tables and graphic drawings. There is also a glossary of special terms, bibliography, and full index to the contents.</p><p>Leon I. Hammer, M.D. is a graduate of Cornell University, Cornell Medical College, and the William A. White Institute of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry. During the early 1970s he studied Chinese medicine in England with Dr. Richard Van Buren, and then apprenticed for eight years in New York and Massachusetts with Dr. John H.F. Shen, a widely recognized master of Chinese pulse diagnosis. Dr. Hammer practiced Chinese medicine until 1990, when he began teaching pulse workshops in the United States and abroad. He is the author of Dragon Rises, Redbird Flies, a study of the relationship between Chinese medicine and Western psychology, and is president of the Dragon Rises School of Oriental Medicine in Gainesville, Florida.</p><h2>Handbook of Health Social Work</h2><p><p><b>The updated third edition of the definitive text on health social work</b></p> <p>Thoroughly revised and updated, the third edition of <i>Handbook of Health Social Work</i> is an authoritative text that offers a comprehensive review of the diverse field of health social work.

Its importance in many areas of pure and applied mathematics has been recognized since the days of Laplace. Asymptotic estimates of series, integrals, and other expressions are commonly needed in physics, engineering, and other fields. Unfortunately, for many years there was a dearth of literature dealing with this difficult but important topic. Then, in 1958, Professor N. G. de Bruijn published this pioneering study. Widely considered the first text on the subject &#x2014; and the first comprehensive coverage of this broad field &#x2014; the book embodied an original and highly effective approach to teaching asymptotics. Rather than trying to formulate a general theory (which, in the author's words, "leads to stating more and more about less and less") de Bruijn teaches asymptotic methods through a rigorous process of explaining worked examples in detail.<br>Most of the important asymptotic methods are covered here with unusual effectiveness and clarity: "Every step in the mathematical process is explained, its purpose and necessity made clear, with the result that the reader not only has no difficulty in following the rigorous proofs, but even turns to them with eager expectation." (<i>Nuclear Physics</i>).<br>Part of the attraction of this book is its pleasant, straightforward style of exposition, leavened with a touch of humor and occasionally even using the dramatic form of dialogue. The book begins with a general introduction (fundamental to the whole book) on O and o notation and asymptotic series in general. Subsequent chapters cover estimation of implicit functions and the roots of equations; various methods of estimating sums; extensive treatment of the saddle-point method with full details and intricate worked examples; a brief introduction to Tauberian theorems; a detailed chapter on iteration; and a short chapter on asymptotic behavior of solutions of differential equations. Most chapters progress from simple examples to difficult problems; and in some cases, two or more different treatments of the same problem are given to enable the reader to compare different methods. Several proofs of the Stirling theorem are included, for example, and the problem of the iterated sine is treated twice in Chapter 8. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter.<br>Since its first publication, <i>Asymptotic Methods in Analysis</i> has received widespread acclaim for its rigorous and original approach to teaching a difficult subject. This Dover edition, with corrections by the author, offers students, mathematicians, engineers, and physicists not only an inexpensive, comprehensive guide to asymptotic methods but also an unusually lucid and useful account of a significant mathematical discipline.</p><p>Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Covert (Dick) de Brujin is Professor Emeritus at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

Challenging those historians who have assumed that the British had the law on their side during the debates that led to the American Revolution, this volume argues that the empire had long exhibited a high degree of constitutional multiplicity, with each colony having its own discrete constitution and the empire as whole having an uncodified working customary constitution that determined the way authority was distributed within the empire. Contending that these constitutions cannot be conflated with the metropolitan British constitution, it argues that British refusal to accept the legitimacy of colonial understandings of the sanctity of the many colonial constitutions and the imperial constitution was the critical element leading to the American Revolution.</p><p>Using the British Empire as a case study, this succinct study argues that the establishment of overseas settlements in America created a problem of constitutional organization that created deep and persistent tensions within the empire during the colonial era and that the failure to resolve it was the principal element in the decision of thirteen continental colonies to secede from the empire in 1776.Jack P.

These are grounded visions of hope and possibility, where social justice forges a new road for economic and environmental sustainability."--Danny Glover<br><br>"Major changes in our society often are not recognized nor understood when they are occurring. "Breakthrough Communities" speaks to one of these: the rapid shift from seeing the metropolitan areas as a collection of legal-political jurisdictions to an understanding of the metropolis as competing, often conflicting, sometimes cooperating communities moving toward emerging visions of equity and shared prosperity in an extraordinary diverse world. These are stories of successes in taking important steps to realize that vision. They are stories told by actual leaders in the struggles. They tell of strategies of change that work. As such this book is a must read for advocacy leaders, elected officials and average citizens trying to understand their communities."--Parris N. Glendening, Maryland Governor (1995-2003), and President, Smart Growth Leadership Institute<br><br>"Occasionally there are books that reframe the way we think and act--and this is one of them. By seeing through a regional lens, it reveals the essential topography of our social structure and the superstructure of our environmental impacts. America's most vexing challenges and golden opportunities lie in reshaping this topography and rethinking its superstructure at a regional scale. Writing here are the leaders of a movement that will change how we address social issues and transform public policy in a systemic way.

This book offers a series of paths that lead us away from the despair and decline of the past, to a 21st century marked by hope, renewal, and transformation.

In "Breakthrough Communities, " Carl Anthony and Paloma Pavel not only saw such seeds--they have cultivated them. The result is a truly visionary work in which multiple positive futures are nested in a "solve-the-whole-problem" approach. Certainly it's a lighthouse that illuminates how cities--the make-it-or-break factor for environmental restoration--are perhaps the most fertile living laboratories of both ecological and social innovation. Certainly it illuminates the historic convergence of the two mighty rivers of the environmental and social justice movements. Certainly it illuminates how multi-cultural alliances and leadership by people of color are permanently changing the landscape of environmentalism.

It discusses the many languages and forms of language that have been used in the US &#x2013; including standard and nonstandard forms of English, creoles, Native American languages, and immigrant languages from across the globe &#x2013; and shows how this distribution and diversity of languages has helped shape and define America as well as an American identity. The volume introduces the basic concepts of sociolinguistics and the politics of language through cohesive, up-to-date and accessible coverage of such key topics as dialectal development and the role of English as the majority language, controversies concerning language use in society, languages other than English used in the US, and the policies that have directly or indirectly influenced language use. </p> <p>These topics are presented in such a way that students can examine the inherent diversity of the communicative systems used in the United States as both a form of cultural enrichment and as the basis for socio-political conflict.&nbsp;The author team outlines the different viewpoints&nbsp;on contemporary issues surrounding language in the US&nbsp;and contextualizes these issues within linguistic facts,&nbsp;to help students think critically and formulate logical discussions.

Brought together for the first time in one volume are important source readings on 25 epochal discoveries that changed man's understanding of the physical world. The accounts, written by the physicists who made them, include:<br>Isaac Newton: The Laws of Motion<br>Henry Cavendish: The Law of Gravitation<br>Augustin Fresnel: The Diffraction of Light<br>Hans Christian Oersted: Elecromagnetism<br>Heinrich Hertz: Electromagnetic<br>James Chadwick: The Neutron<br>Niels Bohr: The Hydrogen Atom, <br>and 17 more.<br>Morris H. Shamos, Professor Emeritus of Physics at New York University, has selected and edited the first published accounts of these important experiments and has also added numerous marginal notes that amplify and clarify the original documents. Moreover, the first 19 experiments can be readily re-created by students in a first-year physics course, making the book ideal for classroom and laboratory work as well as individual reference and study.<br>Finally, Dr. Shamos has provided revealing biographical sketches of the scientists and illuminating references to the political and cultural milieu in which the discoveries are made.

Besides the basic experimental heat transfer and flow friction data, Compact Heat Exchangers contains chapters on heat exchanger analysis and design and auxiliary topics.</p><p></p><h2>Communication, Conflict, and the Management of Difference</h2><p>Humans make distinctions constantly; those distinctions can be barriers, obstacles, or opportunities. Conflict exists when the differences we notice challenge us--when they require work to make them livable. The work of conflict involves making decisions about how to act in a specific situation and how to respond to the actions of others. It means engaging in the potentially hard work of interpreting, thinking in new ways, and creating effective resources for change. The actions, responses, and interpretive schemes that emerge between or among the parties in a conflict determine whether the management of difference moves toward harm or toward value. This book issues an invitation to engage in a thoughtful dialogue about human difference, conflict, and communication. The authors draw numerous examples from their work in mediation; they discuss a variety of definitions, practical tools, models, and theories to help analyze conflict and to manage differences. They encourage readers to learn how communication competence can move discussions away from harmful interactions and empower parties to expand their options. The appendix provides a wealth of information in a succinct format. It discusses basic communication skills; introduces a number of alternative dispute resolution methods, including negotiation, mediation, facilitation, collaboration, and public engagement; and concludes with practical information about dialogue as an important approach to differences.</p><p>Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Cupach et al., Competence in Interpersonal Conflict, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577666493) and Domenici-Littlejohn, Mediation: Empowerment in Conflict Management, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577661887).&#34;I am impressed with this book.

In lively and accessible style, Cicero presents the insights of Greek philosophers on the subject, reporting the views of Epicureans and Peripatetics and giving a detailed account of the Stoic position, which he himself favors for its close reasoning and moral earnestness. Both the specialist and the general reader will be fascinated by the Stoics' analysis of the causes of grief, their classification of emotions by genus and species, their lists of oddly named character flaws, and by the philosophical debate that develops over the utility of anger in politics and war.<br><br>Margaret Graver's elegant and idiomatic translation makes Cicero's work accessible not just to classicists but to anyone interested in ancient philosophy and psychotherapy or in the philosophy of emotion. The accompanying commentary explains the philosophical concepts discussed in the text and supplies many helpful parallels from Greek sources.<br></p><p><b>Margaret Graver</b> is an assistant professor of classics at Dartmouth College.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Auditory Electrophysiology: A Clinical Guide</h2><p><p><strong><em>A practical laboratory-to-clinic guide on the basics of auditory electrophysiology</em></strong></p><p>Written primarily by audiologists familiar with cutting-edge research in a rapidly changing field, <em>Auditory Electrophysiology</em> provides a fresh perspective on the most current advances and practices in the specialty.

It guides teachers step by step to recognize good reader behaviors, assess students' strengths and weaknesses, and make evidence-based instructional decisions. Formal and informal measures are discussed for evaluating specific components of literacy, with a focus on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Every chapter features activities for developing understanding; in-depth practice exercises are provided in several appendices. Helpful reproducible tools can be photocopied from the book or downloaded and printed in a convenient 8 1/2" x 11" size.<br><br> New to This Edition<br> *Chapter on major current initiatives: the CCSS and response to intervention.<br> *Extensive CCSS content woven throughout the book.<br> *Expanded coverage of vocabulary assessment, now in its own chapter.<br> *Checklists to guide the selection of high-quality published instruments.</p><p>JoAnne Schudt Caldwell, PhD, is Professor Emerita at Cardinal Stritch University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she also served as Associate Dean of the College of Education and Leadership. Dr. Caldwell is the author of <i>Comprehension Assessment: A Classroom Guide</i>. She is also coauthor (with Lauren Leslie) of the <i>Qualitative Reading Inventory, 5th Edition</i>, an informal reading inventory; of<i> Intervention Strategies to Follow Reading Inventory Assessment: What Do I Do Now?</i>; and (with Joyce Holt Jennings and Janet W. Lerner) of <i>Reading Problems: Assessment and Teaching Strategies</i>."An excellent resource for teachers, coaches, and administrators. The book provides a thorough review of literacy assessment that is updated with crucial connections to the CCSS. The new chapter on vocabulary assessment focuses on word selection. Appendices spell out important questions teachers and coaches should ask when considering the many facets of literacy assessment. I highly recommend this book for literacy assessment coursework both for practicing teachers who are earning master&#x2019;s degrees and undergraduates preparing for life in the classroom."--Danielle V. Dennis, PhD, Department of Childhood Education and Literacy Studies, University of South Florida<br><br> "Reading this book feels like a conversation with a wise mentor. Caldwell updates her insightful explanation of reading assessment and its ties to instruction by examining them through the lens of the Common Core. She offers practical ideas on how to select, create, and use reading assessments suitable for a response-to-intervention framework. This 'must-have' book offers a great introduction to the complicated topic of reading assessment and should be a staple on the shelves of teachers across the country."--Kristine Marver Lize, MS, literacy coach, School District of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin<br><br> "<i>Reading Assessment, Third Edition</i>, navigates pathways for using assessment to inform instruction. Caldwell explicitly links assessment practices to the CCSS in very helpful ways. She describes types of literacy tests, their purposes, and their uses within the current educational climate. The book skillfully connects good reader behaviors to the CCSS and shows how to use assessment in a way that benefits both students and teachers. Caldwell's careful explanations and accessible style make this book a useful addition to the professional bookshelf."--Barbara P. Laster, EdD, Department of Educational Technology and Literacy, Towson University<br><br> "A timely and valuable resource for general and special educators alike. There are many strengths and great value in this text, particularly in the connections Caldwell draws between the reasons we assess, how to assess as we teach, and instructional implications of assessments. She provides clear discussions of how to conduct informal reading inventories and of the challenges related to administration and scoring that teachers and coaches face on a daily basis. Perhaps most important, this third edition directly addresses the CCSS, as well as ways preservice and practicing teachers can manage the daily demands of high-stakes testing."--Christina R.

With the coming retirement of one or more Supreme Court Justices--and threats to filibuster lower court judges--the selection process is likely to be, once again, the center of red-hot partisan debate.<br> In <em>Advice and Consent</em>, two leading legal scholars, Lee Epstein and Jeffrey A. Segal, offer a brief, illuminating Baedeker to this highly important procedure, discussing everything from constitutional background, to crucial differences in the nomination of judges and justices, to the role of the Judiciary Committee in vetting nominees. Epstein and Segal shed light on the role played by the media, by the American Bar Association, and by special interest groups (whose efforts helped defeat Judge Bork). Though it is often assumed that political clashes over nominees are a new phenomenon, the authors argue that the appointment of justices and judges has always been a highly contentious process--one largely driven by ideological and partisan concerns. The reader discovers how presidents and the senate have tried to remake the bench, ranging from FDR's controversial "court packing" scheme to the Senate's creation in 1978 of 35 new appellate and 117 district court judgeships, allowing the Democrats to shape the judiciary for years. The authors conclude with possible "reforms," from the so-called nuclear option, whereby a majority of the Senate could vote to prohibit filibusters, to the even more dramatic suggestion that Congress eliminate a judge's life tenure either by term limits or compulsory retirement. <br> With key appointments looming on the horizon, <em>Advice and Consent</em> provides everything concerned citizens need to know to understand the partisan rows that surround the judicial nominating process.</p><p><br><strong>Lee Epstein</strong> is the Edward Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor of Political Science and Professor of Law at Washington University and a Fellow of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. She has authored, co-authored, or edited over seventy articles and essays and thirteen books. <br> <strong>Jeffrey A. Segal</strong> is SUNY Distinguished Professor and Chair of Political Science at Stony Brook University.<br><br>"Epstein and Segal's useful primer on the confirmation process makes clear that the American method of choosing federal judges is not always designed to produce moderate candidates. When one party controls both the presidency and the Senate, it gets the chance to alter the legal status quo. Epstein and Segal chart the ideology of presidents against the ideology and voting records of their Supreme Court nominees and show that most justices match up fairly well with their presidents over time."--Emily Bazelon, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Thoughtful and illuminating.... Qualifications matter--as much today as they have in the past. (In that sense, President Bush might have done well to read <em>Advice and Consent</em> before nominating the ill-fated Miers.)"--Jeffrey Rosen, <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em><p></p><br>"A thorough look at the process, politics and presidential aspects of court appointments. Witty yet well-informed, Professors Epstein and Segal give an insight into the whys and wherefores of federal judge appointments."--<em>www.mayitpleasethecourt.com</em><p></p><br>"This is a superb and even indispensable resource. Careful, precise, objective, and nugget-filled, it's a wonderful guide to past, present, and future debates. If you want to know about judicial appointments, this is the best place to start."--Cass R. Sunstein, University of Chicago Law School<p></p><br>"As political scientists Lee Epstein and Jeffrey Segal show in their new and timely book, <em>Advice and Consent</em>, the modern era of politicized nomination battles is nothing new: Politics has suffused the judicial appointment process for 200 years. Writing in pristine, jargon-free language, Epstein and Segal use historical illustrations and the latest quantitative methods to inject some much-needed context and evidence into the current debate about judicial appointments."--Sam Rosenfeld, <em>The American Prospect</em><p></p><br>"There is little doubt that Epstein and Segal are two of the most prominent public law scholars.... They draw together a wealth of research and empirical findings from a plethora of studies, many of which they authored, and fold them into a compelling narrative that examines all levels of the judiciary.... This book combines the best features of past studies on judicial appointments. There are anecdotes to enrich the narrative combined with all manner of empirical results and tables. The book will be a valuable resource for scholars and instructors. It is also very accessible for students and citizens interested in the judicial branch. In addition, this well-written book has the added virtue of being very timely."--Richard L. Pacelle, Jr., <em>Law and Politics Book Review</em><p></p><br>"An important and timely study that adds an essential framework for understanding contemporary slugfests over judicial appointments. Beautifully presented and argued." --Louis Fisher, author of <em>American Constitutional Law</em><p></p><br>"Thoughtful....
